a
safe

here
the
secret
we
pack

an
oxygen

and
you
see
how
it
works
in
our
efforts
to
be
the
good
child
the
uncomplaining
employee
or
the
cooperative
patient
many
of
us
fall
into
the
trap
of
trying
to
please
people
by
going
along
with
whatever
they
want
us
to
do
at
times
we
lose
track
of
our
own
boundaries
and
needs
and
the
cost
of
this
could
be
our
life
both
symbolically
and
literally
when
we
are
unable
to
set
healthy
limits
it
causes
distress
in
our
relationships
but
when
we
learn
to
say
no
to
what
we
don
feel
like
doing
in
order
to
say
yes
to
our
TRUE
self
we
feel
empowered
and
our
relationships
with
others
improve
so
don
be
afraid
to
say
no
try
to
catch
yourself
in
the
moment
and
use
your
TRUE
voice
to
say
what
you
really
want
to
say
some
people
punish
themselves
when
they
are
under
time
pressure
they
delete
all
the
games
on
their
pc
they
stop
going
for
walks
and
they
don
spend
time
with
their
friends
they
then
have
less
pleasure
in
life
and
less
balance
and
their
work
performance
actually
declines
break
out
of
this
pattern
by
paying
more
attention
to
relaxation
and
getting
more
involved
in
living
when
you
are
under
pressure
define
clear
time
periods
for
this
half
an
hour
for
a
walk
ten
minutes
to
play
a
game
on
your
pc
and
so
on
your
mind
will
become
more
creative
during
the
break
and
you
will
become
mentally
fitter
free
time
without
feelings
of
guilt
will
give
you
the
strength
to
do
high
quality
work
in
the
remaining
time
furthermore
a
certain
amount
of
recreation
reduces
the
chances
of
developing
stress
related
disorders
large
animals
are
actually
less
dangerous
to
hikers
than
smaller
ones
common
sense
tells
us
that
we
should
avoid
tigers
bears
and
other
large
threatening
animals
but
smaller
animals
are
actually
more
threatening
than
bigger
animals
to
overcome
disadvantages
of
their
size
small
animals
have
developed
useful
weapons
such
as
poison
to
protect
themselves
in
the
wild
each
year
only
a
few
people
are
attacked
by
tigers
or
bears
and
most
of
these
incidents
are
caused
by
the
people
themselves
however
more
people
are
killed
by
bites
from
small
poisonous
snakes
than
by
these
large
animals
even
more
people
lose
their
lives
from
allergic
reactions
to
common
bee
stings
for
these
reasons
hikers
should
be
careful
about
small
dangerous
creatures
i
hope
you
remember
our
discussion
last
monday
about
the
servicing
of
the
washing
machine
supplied
to
us
three
months
ago
i
regret
to
say
the
machine
is
no
longer
working
as
we
agreed
during
the
meeting
please
send
a
service
engineer
as
soon
as
possible
to
repair
it
the
product
warranty
says
that
you
provide
spare
parts
and
materials
for
free
but
charge
for
the
engineer
labor
this
sounds
unfair
i
believe
the
machine
failure
is
caused
by
a
manufacturing
defect
initially
it
made
a
lot
of
noise
and
later
it
stopped
to
operate
entirely
as
it
is
wholly
the
company
responsibility
to
correct
the
defect
i
hope
you
will
not
make
us
pay
for
the
labor
component
of
its
repair
as
we
all
know
it
is
not
always
easy
to
get
work
done
at
the
office
there
is
a
frequently
rarely
quiet
time
during
regular
business
hours
to
sit
and
concentrate
office
workers
are
regularly
interrupted
by
ringing
phones
impromptu
meetings
and
chattering
coworkers
this
can
be
as
frustrating
for
an
employee
as
it
is
for
the
employer
who
is
paying
for
this
nonproductive
work
time
working
at
home
can
free
you
from
these
b
attractions
distractions
giving
you
long
blocks
of
time
to
focus
on
your
work
although
your
home
may
present
its
own
problems
too
there
are
ways
to
deal
with
them
your
productivity
will
certainly
c
decrease
increase
as
will
the
quality
of
your
work
product
at
the
same
time
you
will
get
to
enjoy
the
personal
satisfaction
of
focusing

gave
more
hours
on
average
than
any
other
age
group
in
all
cultures
in
which
eye
gaze
behavior
has
been
studied
science
confirms
that
those
who
are
dominant
have
more
in
using
it
in
essence
these
individuals
are
entitled
to
look
wherever
they
want
however
subordinates
are
more
restricted
in
where
they
can
look
and
when
humility
dictates
that
in
the
presence
of
royalty
as
in
church
heads
are
bowed
as
a
general
rule
dominants
tend
to
ignore
subordinates
visually
while
subordinates
tend
to
gaze
at
dominant
individuals
at
a
distance
in
other
words
higher
status
individuals
can
be
indifferent
while
lower
status
persons
are
required
to
be
attentive
with
their
gaze
the
king
is
free
to
look
at
anyone
he
wants
but
all
subjects
face
the
king
even
as
they
back
out
of
a
room
the
importance
of
science
has
led
people
to
think
that
objectivity
is
the
best
way
to
see
the
world
to
see
the
facts
without
any
feelings
however
from
a
human
point
of
view
objectivity
is
just
another
attitude
it
is
an
interpretation
that
deliberately
ignores
our
feelings
it
is
very
useful
to
ensure
that
scientific
measurements
are
taken
accurately
and
so
on
but
as
far
as
life
is
concerned
it
is
a
bit
like
turning
the
color
off
on
your
tv
so
that
you
see
everything
in
black
and
white
and
then
saying
that
is
more
truthful
it
is
not
more
truthful
it
is
just
a
filter
that
reduces
the
when
you
turn
down
the
feelings
you
also
turn
down
the
possibility
of
enjoyment
a
sometimes
all
the
outcomes
customers
are
trying
to
achieve
in
one
area
have
a
negative
effect
on
other
outcomes
this
is
very
common
when
companies
are
busy
listening
to
the
voice
of
the
customer 
traveling
salespeople
for
example
may
say
they
want
a
smaller
cell
phone
but
they
may
not
have
thought
about
how
hard
that
tiny
phone
will
be
to
use
carpenters
may
request
a
lightweight
circular
saw
without
thinking
about
the
fact
that
it
will
no
longer
have
the
power
to
get
through
some
of
the
more
difficult
jobs
when
customers
make
requests
for
new
product
features
they
are
usually
focused
on
solving
just
one
problem
and
are
not
thinking
of
how
their
requested
solution
will
in
this
situation
customers
request
new
features
but
reject
the
resulting
product
when
they
realize
the
ramifications
of
their
suggestions
the
added
feature
turns
out
to
be
worthless
because
of
the
problems
it
causes
self
monitoring
refers
to
how
much
people
try
to
control
the
way
they
present
themselves
to
others
those
who
have
high
self
monitoring
want
their
behavior
to
be
socially
acceptable
they
adjust
themselves
to
any
social
signal
that
indicates
appropriate
or
inappropriate
behavior
a
if
they
are
in
a
meeting
and
see
others
making
suggestions
they
will
try
to
make
suggestions
as
well
they
are
also
good
at
managing
what
others
think
about
them
b
those
who
have
low
self
monitoring
are
not
very
sensitive
to
signals
indicating
socially
acceptable
behavior
they
are
not
too
concerned
about
behaving
the
right
way
in
a
specific
context
for
example
if
they
are
in
a
meeting
with
the
president
of
an
organization
they
may
act
bored
they
are
not
deeply
concerned
about
how
others
see
them
you
have
probably
heard
about
sending
messages
across
the
sea
in
bottles
the
problem
is
it
is
impossible
to
tell
how
long
it
will
take
the
sea
to
deliver
its
bottled
messages
or
where
it
will
wash
them
up
a
columbus
was
still
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
europe
and
he
feared
he
would
never
live
to
tell
the
king
and
queen
of
his
discovery
so
he
wrote
the
news
on
a
piece
of
paper
b
in
christopher
columbus
sent
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
famous
bottled
messages
he
was
returning
to
spain
to
tell
the
king
and
queen
about
what
he
had
discovered
when
his
ship
got
caught
in
a
bad
storm
c
he
put
it
in
a
wooden
bottle
and
tossed
it
overboard
more
than
years
later
it
was
found
by
the
captain
of
an
american
ship
off
the
coast
of
africa
near
morocco
life
can
be
like
riding
a
roller
coaster
there
are
ups
and
downs
fast
and
slow
parts
bumps
and
shaky
parts
and
even
times
when
you
upside
down
you
can
control
which
way
the
track
or
in
this
case
life
events
will
take
you
when
you
at
the
bottom
you
can
see
only
what
right
in
front
of
you
but
when
you
get
to
the
top
you
can
see
the
whole
picture
a
lot
better
when
you
starting
out
accept
how
you
feel
and
try
to
enjoy
the
ride
when
you
design
an
amusement
park
for
children
you
should
carefully
consider
the
location
of
the
roller
coaster
when
it
over
you
see
that
it
was
really
cool
even
if
you
couldn
see
that
when
you
first
started
when
tom
had
helped
the
blind
man
to
cross
the
street
he
realized
he
had
left
his
book
bag
on
the
bus
stop
bench
as
tom
was
waiting
for
a
bus
he
noticed
a
blind
man
trying
to
cross
the
street
the
traffic
was
heavy
and
it
was
likely
the
blind
man
would
get
hit
as
he
was
not
crossing
at
a
crosswalk
tom
looked
around
and
saw
there
was
no
one
else
to
help
so
he
asked
the
blind
man
if
he
would
like
help
crossing
the
street
the
blind
man
readily
said
yes
then
latched
onto
tom
arm
and
they
began
their
walk
across
the
street
avoiding
speeding
cars
when
tom
looked
back
at
the
bus
stop
bench
he
saw
another
man
sitting
next
to
his
book
bag
and
when
tom
got
to
the
bus
stop
bench
the
man
said
i
saw
what
you
were
doing
so
i
decided
to
sit
here
and
watch
your
book
bag
i
had
volunteered
for
the
charity
picnic
and
i
needed
to
be
there
on
time
ms
green
the
charity
president
was
preparing
this
monthly
event
by
herself
lily
complained
mom
i
don
feel
like
going
today
we
volunteered
more
than
five
times
this
year
she
was
eating
slower
than
usual
i
urged
her
lily
don
you
remember
we
promised
to
help
ms
green
last
month
go
and
get
dressed
i
stood
by
the
door
and
pointed
at
my
watch
she
slowly
pulled
on
her
sweater
and
said
i
still
don
feel
like
going
i
started
losing
my
patience
i
responded
don
you
know
ms
green
has
a
lot
of
work
to
do
for
the
picnic
today
it
time
you
started
thinking
about
other
people
my
voice
was
growing
louder
with
each
sentence
it
is
well
known
that
some
baseball
parks
are
better
for
hitting
home
runs
than
others
it
is
not
just
the
size
of
the
park
that
matters
other
park
conditions
such
as
wind
and
humidity
also
affect
whether
a
ball
sails
over
the
fences
and
players
know
this
so
what
happens
when
a
player
is
moved
to
a
team
whose
baseball
park
has
better
conditions
for
home
runs
than
his
current
one
say
percent
better
one
analysis
found
that
the
player
hit
percent
more
home
runs
why
the
answer
lies
in
how
achievable
you
think
the
goal
is
if
you
think
you
are
likely
to
hit
more
home
runs
you
are
more
likely
to
swing
for
the
fences
but
if
you
think
your
chance
of
hitting
a
home
run
is
smaller
your
brain
will
send
you
signals
to
just
try
for
a
single
to
get
on
base
in
business
and
life
just
as
in
baseball
our
can
affect
whether
we
swing
for
the
fences
or
not
the
baseball
research
shows
us
that
what
matters
is
not
the
actual
distance
to
the
fence
but
what
our
brains
recognize
that
distance
to
be
consider
your
work
and
your
current
life
do
the
fences
seem
too
far
away
to
hit
a
home
run
simply
adjust
the
fences
so
that
it
seems
easier
it
is
well
known
that
some
baseball
parks
are
better
for
hitting
home
runs
than
others
it
is
not

mom
once
said
that
my
grandmother
came
to
america
as
a
poor
uneducated
greek
immigrant
at
eighteen
my
grandmother
wanted
to
go
to
school
but
the
harsh
immigrant
life
pushed
a
her
to
support
her
family
though
she
never
learned
to
read
in
school
she
knew
many
traditional
stories
from
her
home
country
one
day
when
i
saw
my
grandmother
on
the
street
by
chance
i
noticed
that
b
she
had
difficulty
in
reading
an
english
sign
right
at
that
moment
it
hit
upon
me
to
teach
her
to
read
english
in

for
all
she
had
taught
me
i
talked
to
my
mom
about
it
and
c
she
was
delighted
with
my

so
my

and
i
worked
hard
together
using
books
for
beginners
my
efforts
were
rewarded
only
a
month

on

of

my

decorated
a

with

my

how

my

as
you
are
well
aware
a
great
tragedy
took
place
in
our
city
last
week
some
faulty
electrical
wiring
led
to
a
fire
breaking
out
and
eventually
destroying
an
entire
block
of
homes
in
the
suburbs
from
the
very
beginning
it
was
fanned
by
strong
winds
but
it
would
not
have
spread
so
far
and
so
quickly
if
our
firefighters
had
been
able
to
arrive
at
the
scene
in
time
our
city
has
only
one
fire
station
located
downtown
would
you
please
establish
a
new
fire
station
in
our
area
since
you
are
mayor
of
our
city
we
are
in
urgent
need
of
one
i
look
forward
to
your
response
ellen
langer
learned
from
her
mother
how
to
prepare
a
roast
as
a
little
girl
she
would
watch
as
her
mother
cut
off
a
small
bit
from
one
end
of
the
meat
before
placing
it
in
the
roasting
pan
as
an
adult
she
followed
the
same
routine
however
a
question
occurred
to
her
one
day
why
did
she
have
to
cut
off
the
end
of
the
roast
she
asked
her
mother
who
just
said
she
learned
to
do
it
from
her
own
mother
then
langer
asked
her
grandmother
she
explained
that
when
she
was
a
young
mother
the
only
roasting
pan
she
had
was
too
short
for
a
standard
roast
so
she
had
to
cut
off
the
end
to
fit
it
into
the
pan
she
long
since
gotten
roasting
pans
in
larger
sizes
and
hadn
cut
an
end
off
since
yet
for
years
both
langer
and
her
mother
had
mindlessly
followed
this
routine
in
many
countries
amongst
younger
people
the
habit
of
reading
newspapers
has
been
on
the
decline
and
some
of
the
dollars
previously
a
spent
were
spent
on
newspaper
advertising
have
migrated
to
the
internet
of
course
some
of
this
decline
in
newspaper
reading
has
been
due
to
the
fact
that
we
are
doing
more
of
our
newspaper
reading
online
we
can
read
the
news
of
the
day
or
the
latest
on
business
entertainment
or
b
however
whatever
news
on
the
websites
of
the
new
york
times
the
guardian
or
almost
any
other
major
newspaper
in
the
world
increasingly
we
can
access
these
stories
wirelessly
by
mobile
devices
as
well
as
our
computers
advertising
dollars
have
simply
been
c
followed
following
the
migration
trail
across
to
these
new
technologies
we
take
it
for
granted
that
film
directors
are
in
the
game
of
recycling
adapting
novels
is
one
of
the
most
respectable
of
movie
projects
while
a
book
that
calls
itself
the
novelization
of
a
film
is
considered
barbarous
being
a
hybrid
art
as
well
as
a
late
one
film
has
always
been
in
a
dialogue
with
other
narrative
genres
movies
were
first
seen
as
an
exceptionally
potent
kind
of
illusionist
theatre
the
rectangle
of
the
screen
corresponding
to
the
proscenium
of
a
stage
which
appear
actors
starting
in
the
early
silent
period
plays
were
regularly
turned
into
films
but
filming
plays
did
not
encourage
the
evolution
of
what
truly
was
distinctive
about
a
movie
the
intervention
of
the
camera
its
mobility
of
vision
as
a
source
of
plot
character
and
dialogue
the
novel
seemed
more
suitable
many
early
successes
of
cinema
were
adaptations
of
popular
novels
i
watched
the
beautiful
stretch
of
the
shoreline
as
it
floated
into
view
how
wonderful
it
was
after
two
days
at
sea
i
finally
saw
the
land
of
infinite
opportunities
there
it
was
before
me
smiling
and
inviting
it
was
difficult
for
anyone
to
decline
that
invitation
i
was
full
of
great
plans
to
find
success
in
this
unknown
land
i
had
accepted
a
job
offer
from
dr
gilbert
who
had
opened
a
medical
clinic
at
an
inland
village
last
year
it
gave
me
great
pleasure
to
think
about
how
my
dream
would
become
a
reality
i
looked
again
at
the
coast
the
line
of
distant
mountains
and
shapes
of
houses
were
gradually
emerging
through
the
mist
they
welcomed
me
with
endless
promises
to
say
that
we
need
to
curb
anger
and
our
negative
thoughts
and
emotions
does
not
mean
that
we
should
deny
our
feelings
there
is
an
important
distinction
to
be
made
between
denial
and
restraint
the
latter
constitutes
a
deliberate
and
voluntarily
adopted
discipline
based
on
an
appreciation
of
the
benefits
of
doing
so
this
is
very
different
from
the
case
of
someone
who
suppresses
emotions
such
as
anger
out
of
a
feeling
that
they
need
to
present
a
facade
of
self
control
or
out
of
fear
of
what
others
may
think
such
behaviour
is
like
closing
a
wound
which
is
still
infected
we
are
not
talking
about
rule
following
where
denial
and
suppression
occur
there
comes
the
danger
that
in
doing
so
the
individual
anger
and
resentment
the
trouble
here
is
that
at
some
future
point
they
may
find
they
cannot
contain
these
feelings
any
longer
have
you
ever
heard
anyone
say
of
a
dog
well
he
very
successful
and
lives
in
a
beautiful
house
but
he
not
very
happy
one
reason
most
dogs
are
much
happier
than
most
people
is
that
dogs
aren
affected
by
external
circumstances
the
way
we
are
i
notice
that
even
when
it
pouring
rain
outside
my
dogs
blue
and
celeste
are
still
excited
to
go
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
i
open
the
front
door
to
look
outside
they
beside
me
in
a
flash
standing
expectantly
ready
for
an
adventure
i
usually
wait
for
a
break
in
the
downpour
and
then
we
all
dash
out
together
the
fact
that
the
ground
is
wet
and
there
are
mud
puddles
dotting
the
landscape
while
i
carefully
picking
my
way
around
the
wet
spots
the
dogs
are
joyfully
splashing
right
through
them
they
aren
afraid
to
get
their
paws
dirty
a
in
belding
ground
squirrels
males
leave
home
and
females
mature
in
their
natal
area
this
male
biased
dispersal
creates
an
imbalance
in
the
way
males
and
females
are
related
to
those
individuals
around
them
females
find
themselves
surrounded
by
relatives
while
males
are
generally
in
areas
with
complete
strangers
this
asymmetry
translates
into
females
who
warn
close
kin
by
emitting
alarm
calls
while
males
generally
do
not
emit
calls
since
their
dispersal
from
their
natal
areas
means
their
blood
kin
typically
do
not
benefit
from
such
a
warning
further
support
for
the
kinship
based
alarm
calling
hypothesis
includes
sherman
finding
that
in
the
rare
instances
when
females
do
move
away
from
their
natal
groups
and
into
groups
with
far
fewer
relatives
they
display
a
tendency
to
become
more
active
and
cooperative
adopt
a
more
elaborate
defense
mechanism
than
alarm
calls
by
likening
the
eye
to
a
camera
elementary
biology
textbooks
help
to
produce
a
misleading
impression
of
what
perception
entails
only
in
terms
of
the
physics
of
image
formation
do
the
eye
and
camera
have
anything
in
common
both
eye
and
camera
have
a
lens
that
focuses
light
rays
from
the
outside
world
into
an
image
and
both
have
a
means
of
adjusting
the
focus
and
brightness
of
that
image
both
eye
and
camera
have
a
light
sensitive
layer
onto
which
the
image
is
cast
the
retina
and
film
respectively
however
image
formation
is
only
the
first
step
towards
seeing
obscure
the
much
more
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
which
is
that
the
camera
merely
records
an
image
whereas
the
visual
system
interprets
it
contrasts
in
light
adaptation
between
the
retina
and
film
misunderstandings
of
image
formation
in
the
eye
and
a
camera
close
relationships
between
image
formation
and
interpretation
recent
evidence
suggests
that
the
common
ancestor
of
neanderthals
and
modern
people
living
about
years
ago
may
have
already
been
using
pretty
sophisticated
language
if
language
is
based
on
genes
and
is
the
key
to
cultural
evolution
and
neanderthals
had
language
then
why
did
the
neanderthal
toolkit
show
so
little
cultural
change
moreover
genes
would
undoubtedly
have
changed
during
the
human
revolution
after
years
ago
but
more
in
response
to
new
habits
than
as
causes
of
them
at
an
earlier
date
cooking
selected
mutations
for
smaller
guts
and
mouths
rather
than
vice
versa
at
a
later
date
milk
drinking
selected
for
mutations
for
retaining
lactose
digestion
into
adulthood
in
people
of
western
european
and
east
african
descent
the
appeal
to
a
genetic
change
driving
evolution
gets
gene
culture
co
evolution
backwards
it
is
a
top
down
explanation
for
a
bottom
up
process
to
describe
what
happens
to
common
resources
as
a
result
of
human
greed
garrett
hardin
used
the
example
of
an
area
of
pasture
on
which
all
the
cattle
owners
are
permitted
to
graze
their
animals
free
of
charge
each
cattle
owner
seeks
to
a
his
gain
and
in
doing
so
considers
the
relative
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
adding
one
more
animal
to
the
herd
the
advantage
is
that
the
cattle
owner
receives
the
whole
of
the
profit
from
the
sale
of
the
additional
animal
the
disadvantage
is
that
the
extra
grazing
contributes
to
the
deterioration
of
the
pasture
however
the
disadvantage
is
shared
among
all
the
cattle
owners
using
the
pasture
so
the
individual
owner
suffers
only
a
fraction
of
the
disadvantage
consequently
the
advantage
is
bound
to
b
the
disadvantage
thus
it
is
inevitable
that
more
and
more
animals
will
be
brought
onto
the
pasture
until
overgrazing
totally
destroys
the
pasture
a
in
physics
scientists
invent
models
or
theories
to
describe
and
predict
the
data
we
observe
about
the
universe
newton
theory
of
gravity
is
one
example
einstein
theory
of
gravity
is
another
those
theories
though
they
describe
the
same
phenomenon
constitute
very
different
versions
of
reality
newton
a
imagined
that
masses
affect
each
other
by
exerting
a
force
while
in
einstein
theory
the
effects
occur
through
a
bending
of
space
and
time
and
there
is
no
concept
of
gravity
as
a
force
either
theory
could
be
employed
to
describe
with
great
accuracy
the
falling
of
an
apple
but
newton
would
be
much
easier
to
use
b
for
the
calculations
necessary
for
the
satellite
based
global
positioning
system
gps
that
helps
you
navigate
while
driving
newton
theory
would
give
the
wrong
answer
and
so
einstein
must
be
used
researchers
have
suggested
that
maintaining
good
social
relations
depends
on
two
complementary
processes
being
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
others
and
being
motivated
to
make
amends
or
pay
compensation
when
a
violation
does
occur
in
short
maintaining
good
social
relations
depends
on
the
capacity
for
guilt
martin
l
hoffman
who
has
focused
on
the
guilt
that
comes
from
harming
others
suggests
that
the
motivational
basis
for
this
guilt
is
empathetic
distress
empathetic
distress
occurs
when
people
deny
that
their
actions
have
caused
harm
or
pain
to
another
person
motivated
by
feelings
of
guilt
they
are
inclined
to
make
amends
for
their
actions
making
amends
serves
to
repair
damaged
social
relations
and
restore
group
harmony
anxiety
has
a
damaging
effect
on
mental
performance
of
all
kinds
it
is
in
one
sense
a
useful
response
gone
awry
an
overly
zealous
mental
preparation
for
an
anticipated
threat
but
such
mental
rehearsal
is
a
disastrous
constructive
cognitive
static
when
it
becomes
trapped
in
a
stale
routine
that
captures
attention
intruding
on
all
other
attempts
to
focus
elsewhere
anxiety
undermines
the
intellect
in
a
complex
intellectually
demanding
and
high
pressure
task
such
as
that
of
air
traffic
controllers
for
example
having
chronically
high
anxiety
is
an
almost
sure
predictor
that
a
person
will
eventually
fail
in
training
or
in
the
field
the
anxious
are
more
likely
to
fail
even
given
b
inferior
superior

the
great

lake
in

the
lake
is
fed
by
the

weber

jordan
rivers
and
has
no
outlet
at
the
close
of
the
ice
age
the
entire

was
submerged
beneath
a
lake
of
meltwater
and
overflow
from
the
lake
flowed
into
the
pacific
ocean
through
the
snake

rivers
the
great
climatic
change
the

underwent
and
continued

reduced

although
praise
may
encourage
children
to
continue
an
activity
while
an
adult
is
watching
according
to
recent
studies
they
are
less
likely
to
continue
the
activity

the

leaves
or
to
repeat
the
activity
in

rather
than
increasing

commitment
to
positive
behavior
praise
encourages
children
to
find
ways
to
get
future
verbal
goodies
from
important
adults
in
other
words
praise
is
like
the
large
pink
icing
rose
in
the
center
of
a
cake
it
is
appealing
and
at
first
bite
its
sweetness
tastes
wonderful
a
couple
more
bites
still
might
taste
good
but
it
quickly
becomes
overly
sweet
it
has
only
one
simple
flavor
we
soon
tire
of
it
and
if
we
eat
very
much
at
any
one
time
we
might
even
feel
slightly
ill
it
may
provide
some
quick
energy
but
it
provides
no
nourishment
and
doesn

growth

health
what
dangerous
about
the
internet
is
because
it
has
the
aura
of
technology
around
it
it
has
a
totally
undeserved
instant
credibility
the
fact
that
information
is
conveyed
in
this
high
tech
manner
somehow
adds
authority
to
what
is
conveyed
when
in
fact
the
internet
is
a
global
conveyer
of
unfiltered
unedited
untreated
information
it
is
the
greatest
tool
we
have
not
only
for
making
people
smarter
quicker
but
also
for
making
people
dumber
faster
rumors
published
on
the
internet
now
have
a
way
of
immediately
becoming
facts
this
is
particularly
TRUE
among
people
who
might
not
themselves
have
access
to
the
internet
but
hear
a
piece
of
news
or
gossip
from
the
people
around
them
who
do
have
access
why
is
it
difficult
to
find
a
runner
who
competes
equally
well
in
both
m
and
m
races
the
primary
reason
is
that
our
muscles
contain
two
main
types
of
muscle
fibers
called
slow
and
fast
muscle
fibers
slow
muscle
fibers
are
muscle
cells
that
can
sustain
repeated
contractions
but
don
generate
a
lot
of
quick
power
for
the
body
they
perform
better
in
endurance
exercises
like
long
distance
running
which
require
slow
steady
muscle
activity
fast
muscle
fibers
are
cells
that
can
contract
more
quickly
and
powerfully
than
slow
muscle
fibers
but
fatigue
much
more
easily
they
function
best
for
short
bursts
of
intense
activity
like
weight
lifting
or
sprinting
scientists
should
be
careful
to
reduce
bias
in
their
experiments
a
bias
occurs
when
what
the
scientist
expects
changes
how
the
results
are
viewed
this
expectation
might
cause
a
scientist
to
select
a
result
from
one
trial
over
those
from
other
trials
scientists
can
lessen
bias
by
running
as
many
trials
as
possible
and
by
keeping
accurate
notes
of
each
observation
made
valid
experiments
also
must
have
data
that
are
measurable
this
allows
others
to
compare
the
results
to
data
they
obtain
from
a
similar
experiment
most
importantly
the
experiment
must
be
repeatable
findings
are
supportable
when
other
scientists
perform
the
same
experiment
and
get
the
same
results
i
once
heard
a
woman
say
of
course
he
successful
it
in
his
genes
i
knew
she
wasn
talking
about
me
because
i
was
wearing
shorts
i
also
knew
she
was
wrong
success
is
not
in
our
genes
not
all
children
of
successful
people
become
successful
themselves
many
kids
have
everything
going
for
them
and
end
up
total
disasters
they
do
none
of
the
things
that
helped
their
parents
succeed
the
number
of
unsuccessful
people
who
come
from
successful
parents
is
proof
that
genes
have
nothing
to
do
with
success
you
can
change
your
genes
but
you
can
change
the
people
you
imitate
the
choice
is
up
to
you
so
why
not
imitate
the
best
there
are
hundreds
of
great
people
to
imitate
and
copy
they
have
terrific
advice
about
what
helped
them
succeed
jot
down
notes
and
carry
them
around
in
your
pants
pocket
then
success
will
be
in
your
jeans
even
if
it
not
in
your
genes
in
the
early
s
norway
introduced
a
carbon
tax
on
emissions
from
energy
and
it
did
seem
to
encourage
environmental
innovation
however
unexpected
circumstances
came
when
they
tried
to
apply
this
approach
globally
agreeing
on
international
taxes
on
emissions
was
notoriously
hard
as
we
already
know
that
the
european
union
has
experienced
terrible
difficulties
in
trying
to
regularize
the
complex
and
myriad
differences
in
its
members
sales
taxes
besides
although
sweden
finland
and
denmark
barely
decided
to
introduce
carbon
taxes
during
the
s
they
have
not
harmonized
their
approaches
with
norway
or
with
each
other
if
such
similar
countries
can
come
to
an
agreement
there
is
little
hope
for
doing
so
with
the
vastly
more
diverse
countries
in
the
rest
of
the
world
apologies
often
fail
one
reason
apologies
fail
is
that
the
offender
and
the
victim
usually
see
the
event
differently
examining
personal
narratives
researchers
have
found
that
those
who
cause
harm
tend
to
minimize
the
offense
probably
to
protect
themselves
from
shame
and
guilt
they
also
tend
to
downplay
the
consequences
of
their
actions
these
tendencies
can
inflame
the
anger
of
the
hurt
person
who
in
contrast
may
see
an
offense
as
bigger
than
it
really
is
when
sincere
apologies
are
offered
in
an
ordinary
human
relationship
they
are
readily
accepted
by
the
victims
and
reconciliations
ensue
those
who
are
hurt
tend
to
see
the
act
as
one
with
severe
consequences
and
as
part
of
an
ongoing
pattern
that
is
inexcusable
and
immoral
each
person
has
his
or
her
own
truth
and
there
is
distortion
on
both
sides
therefore
to
apologize
sincerely
we
must
first
listen
attentively
to
how
the
other
person
really
feels
about
what
happened
not
simply
assert
what
we
think
happened
when
you
walk
into
a
store
you
are
besieged
by
information
even
purchases
that
seem
simple
can
quickly
turn
into
a
cognitive
quagmire
look
at
the
jam
aisle
a
rational
models
of
decision
making
suggest
that
the
way
to
find
the
best
product
is
to
take
all
of
this
information
into
account
and
to
carefully
analyze
the
different
brands
on
display
but
this
method
can
backfire
b
a
glance
at
the
shelves
can
inspire
a
whole
range
of
questions
should
you
buy
the
smooth
textured
strawberry
jam
or
the
one
with
less
sugar
does
the
more
expensive
jam
taste
better
c
when
we
spend
too
much
time
thinking
in
the
supermarket
we
can
trick
ourselves
into
choosing
the
wrong
things
for
the
wrong
reasons
making
better
decisions
when
picking
out
jams
or
bottles
of
wine
is
best
done
with
the
emotional
brain
which
generates
its
verdict
automatically
but
now
rock
radio
is
in
seemingly
terminal
decline
and
mtv
doesn
show
many
music
videos
anymore
once
upon
a
time
there
was
only
one
way
to
launch
a
hit
album
radio
nothing
else
reached
as
many
people
as
often
getting
on
a
radio
playlist
was
difficult
but
once
a
song
was
in
heavy
rotation
on
the
radio
it
had
a
high
probability
of
selling
then
in
the
s
came
mtv
which
became
the
second
way
to
create
a
hit
it
had
even
more
limited
capacity
for
new
music
but
its
influence
over
a
generation
was
unparalleled
for
the
music
labels
those
were
good
times
it
was
a
brutally
competitive
business
but
it
was
a
business
they
knew
they
understood
the
rules
and
they
could
earn
their
keep
by
working
them
so
how
to
market
music
labels
know
the
answer
lies
online
tapping
the
word
of
mouth
forces
that
are
replacing
traditional
marketing
in
creating
demand
but
they
still
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
how
best
to
do
it
despite
such
evidence
of
favoritism
toward
handsome
politicians
follow
up
research
demonstrated
that
voters
did
not
realize
their
bias
research
has
shown
that
we
automatically
assign
to
good
looking
individuals
such
favorable
traits
as
talent
kindness
honesty
and
intelligence
furthermore
we
make
these
judgements
without
being
aware
that
physical
attractiveness
plays
a
role
in
the
process
some
consequences
of
this
unconscious
assumption
that
good
looking
equals
good
scare
me
for
example
a
study
of
the
canadian
federal
elections
found
that
attractive
candidates
received
more
than
two
and
a
half
times
as
many
votes
as
unattractive
candidates
in
fact
percent
of
canadian
voters
surveyed
denied
in
the
strongest
possible
terms
that
their
votes
had
been
influenced
by
physical
appearance
only
percent
even
allowed
for
the
possibility
of
such
influence
voters
can
deny
the
impact
of
attractiveness
on
electability
all
they
want
but
evidence
has
continued
to
confirm
its
troubling
presence
why
in
country
after
country
that
mandated
seat
belts
was
it
impossible
to
see
the
promised
reduction
in
road
accident
fatalities
john
adams
professor
of
geography
at
university
college
london
wrote
in
one
of
his
many
essays
on
risk
it
appears
that
measures
that
protect
drivers
from
the
consequences
of
bad
driving
encourage
bad
driving
the
principal
effect
of
seat
belt
legislation
has
been
a
shift
in
the
burden
of
risk
from
those
already
best
protected
in
cars
to
the
most
vulnerable
pedestrians
and
cyclists
outside
cars
adams
started
to
group
these
counterintuitive
findings
under
the
concept
of
risk
compensation
the
idea
that
humans
have
an
inborn
tolerance
for
risk
as
safety
features
are
added
to
vehicles
and
roads
drivers
feel
less
vulnerable
and
tend
to
take
more
chances
the
phenomenon
can
be
observed
in
all
aspects
of
our
daily
lives
children
who
wear
protective
gear
during
their
games
have
a
tendency
to
take
more
physical
risks
hikers
take
more
risks
when
they
think
a
rescuer
can
access
them
easily
according
to
john
adams
the
phenomenon
that
safety
measures
a
careless
driving
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
notion
that
a
greater
sense
of
security
b
people
to
take
more
risks

there
was
a
heavy
rain
but
the
sun
came
out
the
next
day
driving
back
from
the
village
i
stopped
the
car
because
a
small
woodchuck
was
traveling
along
the
road
its
belly
almost
flat
to
the
gravel
i
got
out
took
off
my
sweater
threw
it
over
the
woodchuck
and
wrapped
him
in
it
then
put
him
on
the
floor
of
the
car
while
i
drove
home
i
guessed
the
rain
had
washed
out
his
burrow
if
i
hadn
come
along
a
he
would
have
eventually
died
of
starvation
rescuing
him
i
felt
as
large
as
fate
very
shortly
the
carton
seemed
too
small
i
offered
him
a
nest
made
of
a
covered
box
bedded
with
straw
and
with
a
round
doorway
cut
in
the
front
he
knew
instantly
that
a
hole
spells
home
and
b
he
dashed
inside
every
time
i
came
to
feed
him
he
jumped
into
my
lap
as
eagerly
as
ever
as
the
months
passed
the
chuck
grew
bigger
and
bigger
my
husband
remarked
that
if
i
didn
do
something
soon
i
would
be
chased
around
for
the
rest
of
my
days
by
a
pound
woodchuck
begging
for
milk
at
home
i
put
him
in
the
bathtub
and
my
husband
found
a
large
carton
c
he
put
cat
litter
in
the
bottom
and
straw
on
top
of
that
when
i
put
the
chuck
in
he
gratefully
burrowed
into
the
straw
i
made
a
mixture
of
milk
and
baby
cereal
for
him
when
i
gave
it
to
the
chuck
he
ate
it
greedily
d
he
accepted
me
quickly
if
i
put
my
hand
in
the
carton
he
nibbled
my
fingers
it
became
clear
that
i
was
imprinting
the
woodchuck
and
vice
versa
i
decided
to
put
him
in
a
new
burrow
i
found
a
hole
along
the
wall
of
our
orchard
put
the
chuck
near
it
and
left
him
i
continued
to
visit
him
with
his
milk
each
time
e
he
greeted
me
joyfully
drank
greedily
and
tried
persistently
to
follow
me
back
into
the
house
the
parting
came
unexpectedly
i
went
away
on
a
brief
trip
when
i
came
back
i
saw
no
sign
of
him
in
the
spring
when
i
see
a
large
handsome
woodchuck
playing
on
the
grass
i
will
hope
that
it
is
he
on
may
th
there
was
a
heavy
rain
but
the
sun
came
out
the
next
day
driving
back
from
the
village
i
stopped
the
car
because
a
small
woodchuck
was
traveling
along
the
road
its
belly
almost
flat
to
the
gravel
i
got
out
took
off
my
sweater
threw
it
over
the
woodchuck
and
wrapped
him
in
it
then
put
him
on
the
floor
of
the
car
while
i
drove
home
i
guessed
the
rain
had
washed
out
his
burrow
if
i
hadn
come
along
a
he
would
have
eventually
died
of
starvation
rescuing
him
i
felt
as
large
as
fate
very
shortly
the
carton
seemed
too
small
i
offered
him
a
nest
made
of
a
covered
box
bedded
with
straw
and
with
a
round
doorway
cut
in
the
front
he
knew
instantly
that
a
hole
spells
home
and
b
he
dashed
inside
every
time
i
came
to
feed
him
he
jumped
into
my
lap
as
eagerly
as
ever
as
the
months
passed
the
chuck
grew
bigger
and
bigger
my
husband
remarked
that
if
i
didn
do
something
soon
i
would
be
chased
around
for
the
rest
of
my
days
by
a
pound
woodchuck
begging
for
milk
at
home
i
put
him
in
the
bathtub
and
my
husband
found
a
large
carton
c
he
put
cat
litter
in
the
bottom
and
straw
on
top
of
that
when
i
put
the
chuck
in
he
gratefully
burrowed
into
the
straw
i
made
a
mixture
of
milk
and
baby
cereal
for
him
when
i
gave
it
to
the
chuck
he
ate
it
greedily
d
he
accepted
me
quickly
if
i
put
my
hand
in
the
carton
he
nibbled
my
fingers
it
became
clear
that
i
was
imprinting
the
woodchuck
and
vice
versa
i
decided
to
put
him
in
a
new
burrow

found
a

in
our

the
uncomplaining
employee
or
the
cooperative
patient
many
of
us
fall
into
the
trap
of
trying
to
please
people
by
going
along
with
whatever
they
want
us
to
do
at
times
we
lose
track
of
our
own
boundaries
and
needs
and
the
cost
of
this
could
be
our
life
both
symbolically
and
literally
when
we
are
unable
to
set
healthy
limits
it
causes
distress
in
our
relationships
but
when
we
learn
to
say
no
to
what
we
don
feel
like
doing
in
order
to
say
yes
to
our
TRUE
self
we
feel
empowered
and
our
relationships
with
others
improve
so
don
be
afraid
to
say
no
try
to
catch
yourself
in
the
moment
and
use
your
TRUE
voice
to
say
what
you
really
want
to
say
in
order
to
successfully
release
himself
from
the
control
of
his
parents
a
child
must
be
secure
in
his
parents
power
as
represented
by
their
loving
authority
the
more
effectively
they
communicate
that
authority
the
more
secure
the
child
feels
and
the
better
able
he
is
to
move
away
from
them
toward
a
life
of
his
own
during
this
lengthy
process
whenever
he
feels
threatened
he
turns
back
toward
the
safety
of
his
parents
love
and
authority
in
other
words
it
is
impossible
for
a
child
to
successfully
release
himself
unless
he
knows
exactly
where
his
parents
stand
both
literally
and
figuratively
that
requires
of
course
that
his
parents
know
where
they
themselves
stand
if
they
don
know
where
they
stand
if
in
other
words
they
are
insecure
in
their
authority
they
cannot
communicate
security
to
their
child
and
he
cannot
move
successfully
away
from
them

the
circumstances

the
names
of
pitches
are
associated
with
particular
frequency
values
our
current
system
is
called
a
because
the
note
we
call
a
that
is
in
the
middle
of
the
piano
keyboard
has
been
fixed
to
have
a
frequency
of
hz
this
is
entirely
arbitrary
we
could
fix
a
at
any
frequency
such
as
or
different
standards
were
used
in
the
time
of
mozart
than
today
some
people
claim
that
the
precise
frequencies
affect
the
overall
sound
of
a
musical
piece
and
the
sound
of
instruments
led
zeppelin
a
band
popular
in
the
s
often
tuned
their
instruments
away
from
the
modern
a
standard
to
give
their
music
an
uncommon
sound
and
perhaps
to
link
it
with
the
european
children
folk
songs
that
inspired
many
of
their
compositions
many
purists
insist
on
hearing
baroque
music
on
period
instruments
both
because
the
instruments
have
a
different
sound
and
because
they
are
designed
to
play
the
music
in

original
tuning
standard

that
purists
deem
important
a
a
friend
of
mine
was
sitting
in
the
miami
airport
reading
a
magazine
while
she
waited
to
catch
a
plane
to
new
york
her
attention
was
distracted
by
a
rough
noisy
quarrel
taking
place
at
the
ticket
counter
but
i
must
get
to
new
york
today
an
angry
lady
hotly
told
the
clerk
i
sorry
ma
but
there
are
no
more
seats
available
came
the
reply
but
my
eight
year
old
daughter
is
on
that
plane
i
can
let
her
fly
into
new
york
city
all
by
herself
she
cried
sorry
lady
the
flight
is
full
came
the
same
answer
my
friend
had
been
watching
and
listening
to
the
woman
woeful
story
and
her
heart
was
touched
with
compassion
for
the
distressed
mother
she
walked
over
to
the
ticket
agent
and
offered
to
take
a
later
flight
if
it
meant
the
woman
could
use
her
ticket
to
travel
to
new
york
with
her
daughter
the
agent
welcomed
my
friend
solution
and
quickly
issued
a
revalidated
ticket
to
the
woman
and
then
arranged
for
another
flight

oxygen

the

the
ultimate

force
lies
in
tiny
cellular
factories

called

that
burn
nearly
all

breathe
in

has
a

they

characteristics
on

one
hand
they
help
guarantee
our

when
the

mobilizes
to

it

to

very
efficiently
on
the

free

move
uncontrollably
through
the
body
attacking

rusting
their

piercing
their
membranes
and
corrupting
their

until
the

sometimes
give

these

built
into

are
potent
agents
of

when
people
started
to
plant
stored

stock
deliberately
they
also
began

this
changed
the
evolutionary
pressure
that
these
food
plants
experienced
as
they
no
longer
had
to
survive
in

instead
people
created

clearly
show
that
farmers
selected
for
larger
seeds
and
thinner
seed
coats
thick
seed
coats
are
often
essential
for
seeds
to
survive
in
a
natural
environment
because
the
seeds
of
many
wild
plants
remain
dormant
for
months
until
winter
is
over
and
rain
sets
in
but
under
human
management
thick
seed
coats
are
unnecessary
as
farmers
evade
responsibility
for
storing
seeds
away
from
moisture
and
predators
in
fact
seeds
with
thinner
coats
were
preferred
as
they
are
easier
to
eat

process
into
flour

they

years

his

less
than

after
this
tragedy
his

passed
away
leaving

an
orphan
a
charitable
lady
helped
him
attend
a
local
military
school
he
wanted
to
become
an
officer
but
was
not
allowed
to
because
he
was
the
son
of
a
tailor
in
he
became
a
teacher
at
the
cole
normale
in
paris
during
the
post
revolution
frenzy
he
spoke
out
against
the
use
of
the

for
which
he
almost
lost
his
life
when
napoleon
invaded
egypt
in
fourier

accompanied

having
returned
to
france
fourier
began
his
research
on

his
mathematical

of
heat
conduction
earned
him
lasting
fame
during
his
stay
in

sometimes
all
the
outcomes
customers
are
trying
to
achieve
in
one
area
have
a
negative
effect
on
other
outcomes
this
is
very
common
when
companies
are
busy
listening
to
the
voice
of
the
customer 
traveling
salespeople
for
example
may
say
they
want
a
smaller
cell
phone
but
they
may
not
have
thought
about
how
hard
that
tiny
phone
will
be
to
use
carpenters
may
request
a
lightweight
circular
saw
without
thinking
about
the
fact
that
it
will
no
longer
have
the
power
to
get
through
some
of
the
more
difficult
jobs
when
customers
make
requests
for
new
product
features
they
are
usually
focused
on
solving
just
one
problem
and
are
not
thinking
of
how
their
requested
solution
will
in
this
situation
customers
request
new
features
but
reject
the
resulting
product
when
they
realize
the
ramifications
of
their
suggestions
the
added
feature
turns
out
to
be
worthless
because
of
the
problems
it
causes
the
success
of
human
beings
depends
crucially
on
numbers
and
connections
a
few
hundred
people
cannot
sustain
a
sophisticated
technology
recall
that
australia
was
colonized
years
ago
by
pioneers
spreading
east
from
africa
along
the
shore
of
asia
the
vanguard
of
such
a
migration
must
have
been
small
in
number
and
must
have
traveled
comparatively
light
the
chances
are
they
had
only
a
sample
of
the
technology
available
to
their
relatives
back
at
the
red
sea
crossing
this
may
explain
why
australian
aboriginal
technology
although
it
developed
and
elaborated
steadily
over
the
ensuing
millennia
was
lacking
in
so
many
features
of
the
old
world
elastic
weapons
for
example
such
as
bows
and
catapults
were
unknown
as
were
ovens
it
was
not
that
they
were
primitive
or
that
they
had
mentally
regressed
it
was
that
they
and
did
not
have
a
dense
enough
population
and
therefore
a
large
enough
collective
brain
to
develop
them
much
further
policymaking
is
seen
to
be
more
objective
when
experts
play
a
large
role
in
the
creation
and
implementation
of
the
policy
and
when
utilitarian
rationality
is
the
dominant
value
that
guides
policy
through
the
use
of
the
scientific
method
to
determine
the
facts
of
any
given
policy
situation
the
power
of
social
constructions
is
supposedly
diminished
and
solutions
to
social
problems
are
discovered
in
an
objective
way
this
process
creates
an
illusion
of
neutrality
and
implies
a
transcendence
of
the
pitfalls
and
inequalities
commonly
associated
with
policymaking
from
this
perspective
scientists
and
professionals
emerge
as
the
appropriate
experts
to
be
consulted
in
policymaking
while
local
citizen
input
and
knowledge
is
often
viewed
as
unnecessary
scientific
and
professional
policy
design
does
not
necessarily
escape
the
pitfalls
of
degenerative
politics
scientific
and
professional
expertise
often
relies
on
a
particular
type
of
knowledge
that
is
limited
to
utility
and
rationality
considerations
this
approach
to
policy
typically
does
not
consider
values
and
cultural
factors
that
cannot
be
measured
empirically
scientifically
designed
policies
can
serve
interests
that
run
counter
to
the
public
interest
they
like
many
errors
and
biases
that
seem
irrational
on
the
surface
auditory
looming
turns
out
on
closer
examination
to
be
pretty
smart
animals
like
rhesus
monkeys
have
evolved
the
same
bias
this
intentional
error
functions
as
an
advance
warning
system
manned
by
the
self
protection
subself
providing
individuals
with
a
margin
of
safety
when
they
are
confronted
with
potentially
dangerous
approaching
objects
if
you
spot
a
rhinoceros
or
hear
an
avalanche
speeding
toward
you
auditory
looming
will
motivate
you
to
jump
out
of
the
way
now
rather
than
wait
until
the
last
second
the
evolutionary
benefits
of
immediately
getting
out
of
the
way
of
approaching
dangers
were
so
strong
that
natural
selection
endowed
us
and

although
this
kind
of
bias
might
inhibit

rational
judgment

tasks

mathematics
will
attract
those
it
can
attract
but
it
will
do
nothing
to
overcome
resistance
to
science
science
is
universal
in
principle
but
in
practice
it
speaks
to
very
few
mathematics
may
be
considered
a
communication
skill
of
the
highest
type
frictionless
so
to
speak
and
at
the
opposite
pole
from
mathematics
the
fruits
of
science
show
the
practical
benefits
of
science
without
the
use
of
words
but
those
fruits
are
ambivalent
science
as
science
does
not
speak
ideally
all
scientific
concepts
are
mathematized
when
scientists
communicate
with
one
another
and
when
science
displays
its
products
to
non
scientists
it
need
not
and
indeed
is
not
able
to
resort
to
salesmanship
when
science
speaks
to
others
it
is
no
longer
science
and
the
scientist
becomes
or
has
to
hire
a
publicist
who
dilutes
the
exactness
of
mathematics
in
doing
so
the
scientist
reverses
his
drive
toward
mathematical
exactness
in
favor
of
rhetorical
vagueness
and
metaphor
thus
f
scott
fitzgerald
thought
that
the
test
of
first

intelligence
was
the
ability

hold
two
opposed
ideas
in

at
the

and

shaped
our
brains
in
the
a
direction
confirmation
bias
is
a
term
for
the
way
the
mind
systematically
avoids
confronting
contradiction
it
does
this
by
overvaluing
evidence
that
confirms
what
we
already
think
or
feel
and
undervaluing
or
simply
disregarding
evidence
that
refutes
it
testimony
from
members
of
the
crow
tribe
about
the
destruction
of
their
culture
provides
an
extreme
and
tragic
example
of
this
a
man
named

reported
that
when
the
buffalo
went
away
the
hearts
of
my
people
fell
to
the
ground
and
they
could
not
lift
them
up
again
after
this
nothing
happened
he
was
not
alone
in
describing
the
depth
of
despair
as
the
end
of
history
nothing
happened
after
that
another
crow
warrior
said
we
just
lived
the
emotion
was
so
strong
that

the

that

have
eased
it
oil
and
gas
resources
are
not
likely
to
be
impacted
by
climate
change
because
they
result
from
a
process
that
takes
millions
of
years
and
are
geologically
trapped
a
climate
change
may
not
only
force
the
shutting
down
of
oil
and
gas
producing
areas
but
increase
the
possibility
of
exploration
in
areas
of
the
arctic
through
the
reduction
in

thus
while
climate
change
may
not
impact
these

oil

reserves
and
known
or
potential
resources
could
be
affected
by
new
climate
conditions
since
climate
change
may
affect

to
these

in
siberia
b
the
actual
exploration
challenge
is
the
time
required
to
access

and
deliver

under
extreme
environmental
conditions
where

in

range

frontier
we
tend
to
perceive
the
door
of
a
classroom
as
rectangular
no
matter
from
which
angle
it
is
viewed
actually
the
rectangular
door
of
a
classroom
projects
a
rectangular
image
on
our
retina
only
when
it
is
viewed
directly
from
the
front
a
slowly
the
trapezoid
becomes
thinner
and
thinner
and
all
that
is
projected
on
the
retina
is
a
vertical
line
which
is
the
thickness
of
the
door
these
changes
we
can
observe
and
distinguish
but
we
do
not
accept
them
b
similarly
a
round
coin
is
seen
as
round
even
when
viewed
from
an
angle
at
which
objectively
it
should
appear
elliptical
in
the
same
way
we
see
car
wheels
as
round
even
though
the
retinal
image
is
oval
when
viewed
from
an
angle
other
than
directly
from
the
front
c
at
other
angles
the
image
will
be
seen
as
a
trapezoid
the
edge
of
the
door
towards
us
looks
wider
than
the
edge
hinged
with
the
frame
so
when
someone
is
threatening
to
go
to
war
or
trying
to
convince
us
and
mounting
a
huge
public
relations
campaign
to
justify
it
the
news
media
have
a
responsibility
to
question
everything
it
important
that
the
media
provide
us
with
diverse
and
opposing
views
so
we
can
choose
the
best
available
options
let
take
the
example
of
going
to
war
war
should
be
a
last
resort
obviously
undertaken
when
all
other
options
have
failed
they
should
be
providing
the
most
intense
scrutiny
on
our
behalf
so
the
public
can
see
the
other
side
of
things
otherwise
we
may
be
drawn
into
unnecessary
wars
or
wars
fought
for
reasons
other
than
those
presented
by
governments
and
generals
most
of
the
time
the
media
fail
to
perform
this
crucial
role
even
the
large
so
called
liberal
american
media
have
admitted
that
they
have
not
always
been
watchdogs
for
the
public
interest
and
that
their
own
coverage
on
some
major
issues
looks
strikingly
one
sided
at
times
low
balling
describes
the
technique
where
two
individuals
arrive
at
an
agreement
and
then
one
increases
the
cost
to
be
incurred
by
the
other
for
example
after
the
consumer
has
agreed
to
purchase
a
car
for
the
salesperson
begins
to
add
on
for
tax
and
for
tires
these
additional
costs
might
be
thought
of
as
a
metaphorical
low
ball
that
the
salesperson
throws
the
consumer
one
explanation
for
the
effectiveness
of
low
balling
is
in
terms
of
self
perception
theory
when
the
consumer
agrees
to
purchase
the
product
under
the
original
terms
that
behavior
might
be
used
by
the
consumer
to
infer
his
sincere
interest
in
the
product
this
inferred
sincere
interest
in
the
product
may
enable
him
to
endure
the
increased
cost
an
alternative
explanation
is
in
terms
of
impression
management
theory
if
the
consumer
were
to
withdraw
from
the
deal
after
the
slight
change
in
the
terms
of
agreement
he
might
foster
the
rather
undesirable
impression
of
being
an
irresponsible
consumer
unaware
of
these
necessary
charges
low
balling
is
effective
in
sales
contexts
because
the
consumer
by
not
withdrawing
from
the
deal
tends
to
a
his
purchase
decision
or
tries
to
save
b
there
is
a
difference

this
digital
age
images
are
essential
units
of
information
and
knowing
how
to
use
photography
effectively
is
more
important
than
ever
fortunately
enrolling
at
the
hobbiton
institute
of
photography
is
one
of
the
easiest
most
cost
effective
ways
to
take
your
photography
to
the
next
level
you
be
assigned
a
personal
adviser
have
your
work
evaluated
by
experienced
experts
and
receive
insightful
suggestions
on
how
to
make
it
better
you
also
learn
to
think
on
your
feet
and
develop
the
eye
of
a
photographer

can
pursue
your
passion
with

one
day
in
february
stephanie
called
betty
her
best
friend
who
was
the
only
employee
of
her
business
best
wedding
once
again
they
discussed
the
company
expenses
and
dwindling
revenue
but
this
time
stephanie
knew
what
she
had
to
do
she
gathered
up
her
courage
and
told
her
friend
and
colleague
i
have
to
make
this
work
i
have
to
let
you
go
betty
was
hurt
but
wasn
particularly
surprised
in
a
businesslike
fashion
the
two
women
began
figuring
out
how
to
disengage
betty
said
she
wanted
to
start
her
own
event
planning
business
and
stephanie
agreed
to
let
her
keep
her
existing
clients
some
photography
and
documents
and
forms
they
had
developed
together
she
also
gave
betty
two
months
salary
as
severance
pay
on
january
a
ship
a
traveled
traveling
through
rough
seas
lost
cargo
containers
one
of
which
held
floating
bath
toys
brightly
colored
ducks
frogs
and
turtles
were
set
adrift
in
the
middle
of
the
pacific
ocean
after
seven
months
the
first
toys
made
landfall
on
beaches
near
sitka
alaska
kilometers
from
b
what
where
they
were
lost
other
toys
floated
north
and
west
along
the
alaskan
coast
and
across
the
bering
sea
some
toy
animals
stayed
at
sea
c
even
very
longer
they
floated
completely
along
the
north
pacific
currents
ending
up
back
in
sitka
researchers
studied
two
mobile
phone
companies
trying
to
solve
a
technological
problem
one
company
developed
what
it
called
a
technology
shelf 
created
by
a
small
group
of
engineers
on
which
was
placed
possible
technical
solutions
that
other
teams
might
use
in
the
future
it
also
created
an
open
ended
conversation
among
its
engineers
in
which
salespeople
and
designers
were
often
included
the
boundaries
among
business
units
were
deliberately
ambiguous
because
more
than
technical
information
was
needed
to
get
a
feeling
for
the
problem
however
the
other
company
proceeded
with
more
seeming
clarity
and
discipline
dividing
the
problem
into
its
parts
different
departments
protected
their
territory
individuals
and
teams
competing
with
each
other
stopped
sharing
information
the
two
companies
did
eventually
solve
the
technological
problem
but
the
latter
company
had
more
difficulty
than
the
former
during
the
kyoto
negotiations
brazil
made
a
suggestion
that
has
since
become
known
as
the
brazilian
proposal
its
idea
was
that
countries
should
now
share
the
burden
of
emissions
cuts
according
to
how
historically
responsible
they
were
for
the
problem
in
other
words
we
should
calculate
what
concentration
of
greenhouse
gases
each
country
has
put
into
the
atmosphere
over
time
and
use
those
figures
to
allocate
emissions
cuts
that
would
mean
for
instance
that
countries
such
as
germany
and
the
united
kingdom
which
have
been
emitting
for
longer
than
most
countries
would
bear
a
larger
share
than
their
current
emissions
implied
greenhouse
gases
have
been
known
to
absorb
heat
and
hold
this
heat
in
the
atmosphere
instead
of
reflecting
it
back
into
space
it
would
also
mean
that
big
emitters
that
had
developed
their
industries
more
recently
such
as
australia
would
bear
less
of
a
share
it
started
out
like
any
other
day
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
in
for
one
of
the
most
terrifying
experiences
of
my
life
i
headed
to
the
beach
and
jumped
on
my
surfboard
and
paddled
out
i
was
about
yards
off
the
beach
when
i
felt
a
sudden
chill
in
the
air
followed
by
an
uncomfortable
stillness
suddenly
i
heard
the
lifeguard
scream
get
out
of
the
water
there
was
a
certain
panic
in
his
voice
that
demanded
attention
then
i
saw
something
approaching
me
in
the
water
it
was
big
and
gray
and
closing
in
on
me
fast
i
tried
to
paddle
back
to
shore
but
my
arms
and
legs
were
paralyzed
many
people
use
their
cleverness
to
justify
and
excuse
themselves
for
the
messiness
of
their
workspaces
they
say
things
like
i
know
where
everything
is
or
they
say
non
humorous
things
such
as
a
clean
desk
is
a
sign
of
a
sick
mind
however
people
who
say
they
know
where
everything
is
turn
out
to
be
using
a
large
amount
of
their
mental
capacity
and
creative
energies
remembering
where
they
placed
things
rather
than
doing
the
job
if
they
worked
in
a
well
organized
environment
for
any
length
of
time
they
would
be
surprised
at
how
much
more
productive
they
were
if
you
have
a
tendency
to
attempt
to
explain
a
messy
desk
or
work
area
challenge
yourself
to
work
with
a
clean
desk
for
an
entire
day
the
result
will
amaze
you
what
you
do
in
the
to
minutes
after
eating
your
evening
meal
sends
powerful
signals
to
your
metabolism
you
set
the
stage
for
more
vigor
throughout
the
evening
hours
along
with
a
weight
loss
benefit
if
you
stay
after
your
meal
among
many
possible
activities
walking
is
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
get
some
minutes
of
exercise
after
a
meal
in
fact
research
shows
that
if
you
walk
after
a
meal
you
may
burn
percent
more
calories
than
if
you
walk
the
same
time
distance
and
intensity
on
an
empty
stomach
interestingly
people
are
more
overconfident
when
they
feel
like
they
have
control
of
the
outcome
even
when
this
is
clearly
not
the
case
for
example
it
is
documented
that
if
people
are
asked
to
bet
on
whether
a
coin
toss
is
heads
or
tails
most
bet
larger
amounts
if
the
coin
is
yet
to
be
tossed
if
the
coin
is
tossed
and
the
outcome
is
concealed
people
will
offer
lower
amounts
when
asked
for
bets
people
act
as
if
in
this
case
control
of
the
outcome
is
clearly
an
illusion
this
perception
occurs
in
investing
as
well
even
without
information
people
believe
the
stocks
they
own
will
perform
better
than
stocks
they
do
not
own
however
ownership
of
a
stock
only
gives
the
illusion
of
having
control
of
the
performance
of
the
stock
the
amount
of
the
bet
will
influence
the
outcome
their
involvement
will
somehow
affect
the
outcome
of
the
toss
there
is
a
parallel
between
a
coin
toss
and
stock
investments
their
illusion
will
not
disappear
even
after
the
coin
is
tossed
they
can
predict
the
outcome
with
credible
information
the
truth
is
that
everyone
has
a
story
every
person
we
meet
has
a
story
that
can
in
some
way
inform
us
and
help
us
as
we
live
the
story
of
our
own
lives
when
we
acknowledge
this
truth
and
begin
to
look
at
others
as
we
open
ourselves
up
to
new
possibilities
in
our
lives
in
reality
the
people
who
are
most
different
from
us
probably
have
the
most
to
teach
us
the
more
we
surround
ourselves
with
people
who
are
the
same
as
we
are
who
hold
the
same
views
and
who
share
the
same
values
the
greater
the
likelihood
that
we
will
shrink
as
human
beings
rather
than
grow
although
there
are
numerous
explanations
for
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
the
deeper
cause
lies
in
the
declining
fertility
of
its
soil
and
the
decrease
in
agricultural
yields
italy
was
densely
forested
at
the
beginning
of
roman
rule
by
the
end
of
the
roman
imperium
however
italy
had
been
stripped
of
forest
cover
the
timber
was
sold
on
the
open
market
and
the
soil
converted
to
crops
and
pastureland
the
cleared
soil
was
rich
in
minerals
and
nutrients
and
provided
substantial
production
yields
unfortunately
deforestation
left
the
soil
exposed
to
harsh
weather
wind
blew
across
the
barren
landscapes
and
water
ran
down
from
the
mountaintops
and
slopes
taking
the
soil
with
them
overgrazing
of
livestock
resulted
in
further
deterioration
of
the
soil
consequently
rome
could
not
provide
sufficient
energy
to
maintain
its
infrastructure
and
the
welfare
of
its
citizens
the
identical
claim
expressed
in
two
social
contexts
may
have
different
qualifiers
when
talking
among
friends
you
might
say
luc
is
the
world
finest
restaurant
when
speaking
to
a
group
of
french
chefs
you
might
find
yourself
saying
luc
is
an
excellent
restaurant
comparable
to
some
of
the
best
in
france
why
did
you
say
it
differently
perhaps
because
you
expected
a
different
critical
scrutiny
in
the
two
groups
maybe
because
your
was
strong
enough
for
friends
but
not
as
strong
among
the
most
knowledgeable
in
each
instance
you
communicated
the
extent
to
which
you
wanted
to
qualify
your
claim
to
guard
yourself
by
restricting
the
extent
to
which
you
are
willing
to
be
held
accountable
for
the
claim
often
in
social
scientific
practice
even
where
evidence
is
used
it
is
not
used
in
the
correct
way
for
adequate
scientific
testing
in
much
of
social
science
evidence
is
used
only
to
affirm
a
particular
theory
to
search
for
the
positive
instances
that
uphold
it
but
these
are
easy
to
find
and
lead
to
the
familiar
dilemma
in
the
social
sciences
where
we
have
two
conflicting
theories
each
of
which
can
claim
positive
empirical
evidence
in
its
support
but
which
come
to
opposite
conclusions
how
should
we
decide
between
them
here
the
scientific
use
of
evidence
may
help
for
what
is
distinctive
about
science
is
the
search
for
negative
instances
the
search
for
ways
to
falsify
a
theory
rather
than
to
confirm
it
the
real
power
of
scientific
testability
is
negative
not
positive
testing
allows
us
not
merely
to
confirm
our
theories
but
to
the
term
euphemism
derives
from
a
greek
word
meaning
to
speak
with
good
words
and
involves
substituting
a
more
pleasant
less
objectionable
way
of
saying
something
for
a
blunt
or
more
direct
way
why
do
people
use
euphemisms
they
do
so
probably
to
help
smooth
out
the
rough
edges
of
life
to
make
the
unbearable
bearable
and
the
offensive
inoffensive
a
euphemisms
can
become
dangerous
when
they
are
used
to
create
misperceptions
of
important
issues
b
a
politician
may
indicate
that
one
of
his
statements
was
somewhat
at
variance
with
the
truth 
meaning
that
he
lied
even
more
serious
examples
include
describing
rotting
slums
as
substandard
housing 
making
the
miserable
conditions
appear
reasonable
and
the
need
for
action
less
important
until
the 
there
were
only
three
competitive
swimming
strokes
freestyle
backstroke
and
breaststroke
and
each
had
specific
rules
that
described
how
it
was
to
be
performed
the
rules
of
breaststroke
stated
that
both
arms
must
be
pulled
together
underwater
and
then
recovered
simultaneously
back
to
the
start
of
the
pulling
position
to
begin
the
next
stroke
most
people
interpreted
this
arm
recovery
to
mean
an
underwater
recovery
in
the 
however
someone
challenged
the
rules
and
reinterpreted
this
arm
recovery
to
be
an
out
of
the
water
recovery
since
this
new
breaststroke
was
about
slower
people
using
the
conventional
version
couldn
effectively
compete
something
had
to
be
done
to
solve
the
problem
finally
this
new
stroke
now
known
as
the
butterfly
won
recognition
as
the
fourth
swimming
stroke
and
became
an
olympic
event
in
even
those
of
us
who
claim
not
to
be
materialistic
can
help
but
form
attachments
to
certain
clothes
like
fragments
from
old
songs
clothes
can
a
evoke
erase
both
cherished
and
painful
memories
a
worn
thin
dress
may
hang
in
the
back
of
a
closet
even
though
it
hasn
been
worn
in
years
because
the
faint
scent
of
pine
that
lingers
on
it
is
all
that
remains
of
someone

summer
a

white
scarf
might
be
pulled
out
of

bag
at

because
of
the
promise
of

it

history
for
us
the
same
way
that
fossils
chart
time
for
archaeologists
living
things
naturally
return
to
a
state
of
balance
when
we
are
disturbed
by
forces
acting
on
us
our
inner
machinery
kicks
in
and
returns
us
to
a
balanced
state
of
equilibrium
homeostasis
is
the
word
we
use
to
describe
the
ability
of
an
organism
to
maintain
internal
equilibrium
by
adjusting
its
physiological
processes
most
of
the
systems
in
animal
and
human
physiology
are
controlled
by
homeostasis
we
don
like
to
be
off
balance
we
tend
to
keep
things
in
a
stable
condition
this
system
operates
at
all
levels
our
blood
stays
the
same
temperature
except
for
extraordinary
exceptions
when
people
find
ways
to
intervene
using
methods
more
powerful
than
our
tendency
to
equilibrium
our
habits
behaviors
thoughts
and
our
quality
of
life
stay
pretty
much
the
same
too
all
of
us
use
the
cultural
knowledge
we
acquire
as
members
of
our
own
society
to
organize
our
perception
and
behavior
most
of
us
are
also
naive
realists
we
tend
to
believe
our
culture
mirrors
a
reality
shared
by
everyone
but
cultures
are
different
and
other
people
rarely
behave
or
interpret
experience
according
to
our
cultural
plan
for
example
an
american
anthropologist
attempted
to
tell
the
classic
story
of
hamlet
to
tiv
elders
in
west
africa
she
believed
that
human
nature
is
pretty
much
the
same
the
whole
world
over
at
least
the
general
plot
and
motivation
of
the
great
tragedy
would
always
be
clear
but
at
each
turn
in
the
story
when
she
told
it
the
tiv
interpreted
the
events
and
motives
in
hamlet
using
their
own
cultural
knowledge
the
result
was
a
very
different
version
of
the
classic
play
the
graphs
above
show
the
percentage
of
world
electricity
generation
by
sources
of
energy
for
and
according
to
the
graphs
the
primary
source
of
electricity
generation
in
both
and
was
coal
and
peat
accounting
for
over
of
the
total
electricity
generation
oil
showed
the
biggest
decrease
in
electricity
generation
which
fell
from
in
to
in
the
source
that
showed
the
biggest
increase
was
nuclear
which
rose
from
in
to
in
in
hydro
was
the
second
biggest
source
of
electricity
generation
but
in
gas
was
the
second
biggest
accounting
for
more
than
of
the
total
electricity
generation
besides
coal
and
peat
hydro
was
the
only
source
that
accounted
for
more
than
of
the
total
electricity
generation
in
both
and
giorgio
vasari
the
italian
painter
architect
and
writer
was
born
in
arezzo
in
he
was
considered
to
be
more
successful
as
an
architect
than
a
painter
but
what
made
him
truly
famous
was
his
book
lives
of
the
most
eminent
painters
sculptors
and
architects
shortened
as
lives
it
is
not
known
exactly
how
many
copies
of
the
first
edition
of
lives
published
in
were
printed
but
it
earned
vasari
the
praise
of
his
peers
then
in
a
revised
edition
of
lives
in
complete
with
portraits
of
the
artists
he
combined
biographical
anecdotes
with
critical
comment
although
the
revised
edition
overshadowed
vasari
own
achievements
as
a
painter
and
architect
it
made
him
the
most
respected
man
of
the
italian
art
world
he
was
even
knighted
by
pope
pius
in
the
good
news
is
that
it
never
too
late
to
start
building
up
muscle
strength
regardless
of
your
age
ideally
though
it
best
to
start
in
your
mid
forties
when
muscle
mass
starts
to
decline
significantly
once
you
started
it
can
take
just
six
weeks
to
see
an
improvement
of
up
to
percent
in
your
muscle
capabilities
says
dr
ward
studies
have
found
that
intense
programs
of
strength
training
can
help
even
weak
older
people
double
their
strength
as
well
as
enable
them
to
walk
faster
and
climb
stairs
more
easily
and
muscle
isn
all
you
gain
strength
training
can
help
combat
osteoarthritis
depression
and
risk
factors
for
heart
disease
and
diabetes
standard
english
allows
access
to
certain
educational
and
economic
opportunities
which
is
the
primary
reason

students
realize
this
when
they
interview
for

when
they
plan
for

what
should
teachers
do
when
a
student
says
i
ain
got
no
pencil
or
brings
some
other
nonstandard
dialect
into
the
classroom
opinions
vary
from
rejection
and
correction
to
complete
acceptance
the
approach
most
consistent
with
culturally
responsive
teaching
is
to
first
accept
the
dialect
and
then
build
on
it
for
example
when
the
student
says
i
ain
got
no
pencil
the
teacher
might
say
oh
you
don
have
a
pencil
what
should
you
do
then
although
results
won
be
apparent
immediately
the
long
range
benefits
both
for
language
development
and
attitudes
toward
school
are
worthwhile
emotional
eaters
manifest
their
problem
in
lots
of
different
ways
for
many
people
one
of
the
classic
signs
of
emotional
eating
is
night
eating
night
eaters
are
often
eating
in
response
to
anxiety
or
to
the
emotional
turmoil
they
experienced
throughout
the
day
boredom
and
loneliness
are
also
more
likely
to
come
to
the
surface
when
the
rush
of
the
day
is
done
and
the
night
stretches
ahead
sometimes
emotional
eating
is
a
reaction
to
a
specific
situation
you
had
a
bad
day
at
work
the
kids
have
been
so
demanding
that
you
are
completely
worn
out
you
and
your
significant
other
are
fighting
it
doesn
matter
what
the
circumstances
are
the
end
result
is
that
times
out
of
you
end
up
on
the
couch
with
a
bowl
of
chips
or
bag
of
cookies
in
your
hand
telling
yourself
it
the
only
way
you
can
relax
giving
people
the
latitude
and
flexibility
to
use
their
judgment
and
apply
their
talents
rapidly
accelerates
progress
send
a
message
of
respect
and
inspire
people
to
be
creative
and
use
their
individual
talents
toward
the
goals
of
the
enterprise
empower
people
by
letting
them
know
that
you
believe
in
them
and
allowing
them
to
take
action
trusting
people
and
empowering
them
also
allows
you
to
focus
on
the
things
you
need
to
accomplish
ellyn
mccolgan
says
i
used
to
say
to
people
all
the
time
i
can
help
you
figure
out
just
about
any
problem
you
throw
at
me
but
is
that
really
what
you
want
from
me 
they
would
look
at
me
funny
and
say
not
really 
i
would
say
i
think
what
you
would
like
is
to
do
a
great
job
and
then
give
me
an
opportunity
to
say
great
job 
then
they
would
respond
yes
that
true 
a
it
because
television
focuses
on
news
that
makes
the
world
seem
like
a
more
dangerous
place
than
it
actually
is
afraid
of
the
world
that
is
portrayed
on
tv
people
stay
in
their
homes
with
close
family
and
do
not
build
bonds
with
their
neighbors
b
these
are
legitimate
concerns
that
many
people
share
we
live
in
difficult
and
uncertain
times
but
are
these
fears
real
research
shows
that
people
who
watch
a
lot
of
news
on
television
overestimate
the
threats
to
their
well
being
why
c
thus
they
become
more
vulnerable
surrounding
ourselves
with
a
wall
of
fear
however
is
not
the
answer
the
only
way
to
overcome
this
problem
is
to
be
more
connected
to
others
and
this
connection
will
reduce
fear
and
isolation
sperm
whales
travel
in
social
groups
that
cooperate
to
defend
and
protect
each
other
and
may
even
share
suckling
of
calves
it
is
difficult
to
determine
the
membership
of
these
groups
from
sightings
alone
because
of
the
practical
difficulties
of
observing
whale
behavior
most
of
which
happens
underwater
to
make
things
even
more
difficult
sperm
whales
can
travel
across
entire
oceans
and
can
dive
to
a
depth
of
a
kilometer
biologists
who
study
whale
behavior
generally
have
to
be
content
with
hanging
around
in
boats
waiting
for
their
subjects
to
surface
but
when
they
do
surface
in
addition
to
taking
photos
which
allow
individual
whales
to
be
identified
biologists
can
zip
over
in
worryingly
small
boats
and
pick
up
the
bits
of
skin
that
the
whales
leave
behind
on
the
surface
when
they
re
submerge
this
has
allowed
researchers
to
describe
sperm
whale
social
groups
in
detail
mediation
is
a
process
that
has
much
in
common
with
advocacy
but
is
also
crucially
different
it
parallels
advocacy
in
so
far
as
it
tends
to
involve
a
process
of
negotiation
but
differs
in
so
far
as
mediation
involves
adopting
a
neutral
role
between
two
opposing
parties
rather
than
taking
up
the
case
of
one
party
against
another
at
times
particularly
in
very
complex
situations
the
processes
of
advocacy
and
mediation
can
overlap
perhaps
with
very
problematic
results
as
one
loses
clarity
over
his
or
her
role
it
is
therefore
important
if
not
essential
to
maintain
a
clear
focus
in
undertaking
advocacy
or
mediation
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
roles
do
not
become
blurred
and
therefore
potentially
counterproductive
for
example
a
mediator
who
takes
sides
is
likely
to
lose
all
credibility
as
is
an
advocate
who
seeks
to
adopt
a
neutral
position
although
both
deal
with
negotiation
a
mediator
needs
to
maintain
a
and
an
advocate

kate

who
had

each

for
three
months
were

in

apartment
after

conversation
joan
went
to
prepare
coffee
soon
she
came
back
with
the
cups
and
saucers
and
put
them
down
on
a

side
table
while
joan
was
looking
for
a
tablecloth
kate
was
wandering
around
the
room
looking
at
the
pictures
on
the
walls
intent
on
one
of
the
pictures
she
took
a
step
back
and
hit
the
small
table
tipping
it
over
all
the
cups
and
saucers
were
broken
kate
felt
guilty
for
her
negligence
as
she
helped
joan
clean
up
she
tried

the
word
courage
takes
on
added
meaning
if
you
keep
in
mind
that
it
is
derived
from
the
latin
word
cor
meaning
heart 
the
dictionary
defines
courage
as
a
quality
which
enables
one
to
pursue
a
right
course
of
action
through
which
one
may
provoke
disapproval
hostility
or
contempt 
over
years
ago
la
rochefoucauld
went
a
step
further
when
he
said
perfect
courage
is
to
do
unwitnessed
what
we
should
be
capable
of
doing
before
all
men
it
is
not
easy
to
show
moral
courage
in
the
face
of
either
indifference
or
opposition
but
persons
who
are
daring
in
taking
a
wholehearted
stand
for
truth
often
achieving
results
that
surpass
their
expectations
on
the
other
hand
halfhearted
individuals
are
seldom
distinguished
for
courage
even
when
it
involves
their
own
welfare
to
be
courageous
under
all
circumstances
requires
strong
determination
we
anticipate
the
future
as
if
we
found
it
too
slow
in
coming
and
we
were
trying
to
hurry
it
up
a
so
such
imprudent
are
we
that
we
wander
about
in
times
that
are
not
ours
and
do
not
think
of
the
one
that
belongs
to
us
we
try
to
support
the
present
with
the
future
and
b
think
thinking
of
arranging
things
we
cannot
control
for
a
time
we
have
no
certainty
of
reaching
examine
your
thoughts
and
you
will
find
them
wholly
c
to
occupy
occupied
with
the
past
or
the
future
we
almost
never
think
of
the
present
and
if
we
do
so
it
is
only
to
shed
light
on
our
plans
for
the

the

and
the

are
our

only
the

is
our
end
consider
the
following
implication
involving
the
role
of
social
bonds
and
affection
among
group
members
if
strong
bonds
make
even
a
single
dissent
less
likely
the
performance
of
groups
and
institutions
will
be
impaired
a
study
of
investment
clubs
showed
that
the
worst
performing
clubs
were
built
on
affective
ties
and
were
primarily
social
while
the
best
performing
clubs
limited
social
connections
and
focused
on
making
money
dissent
was
far
more
frequent
in
the
high
performing
clubs
the
low
performers
usually
voted
unanimously
with
little
open
debate
as
illustrated
in
the
study
the
high
performers
placed
more
importance
on
social
bonds
than
the
low
performers
resulting
in
their
high
rate
of
success
the
central
problem
is
that
the
voters
in
low
performing
groups
were
trying
to
build
social
cohesion
rather
than
to
produce
the
highest
returns
i
have
always
taught
my
children
that
politeness
learning
and
order
are
good
things
and
that
something
good
is
to
be
desired
and
developed
for
its
own
sake
but
at
school
they
learned
and
very
quickly
that
children
earn
nature
trail
tickets
for
running
the
quarter
mile
track
during
lunch
recess
or
lincoln
dollars
for
picking
up
trash
on
the
playground
or
for
helping
a
young
child
find
the
bathroom
deeds
that
used
to
be
called
good
citizenship 
why
is
it
necessary
to
buy
the
minimal
cooperation
of
children
with
rewards
and
treats
what
disturbs
me
is
the
idea
that
good
behavior
must
be
reinforced
with
incentives
children
must
be
taught
to
perform
good
deeds
for
their
own
sake
not
in
order
to
receive
stickers
stars
and
candy
bars
a
in
a
classic
set
of
studies
over
a
ten
year
period
biologist
gerald
wilkinson
found
that
when
vampire
bats
return
to
their
communal
nests
from
a
successful
night
foraging
they
frequently
vomit
blood
and
share
it
with
other
nest
mates
including
even
non
relatives
the
reason
it
turns
out
is
that
blood
sharing
greatly
improves
each
bat
chances
of
survival
a
bat
that
fails
to
feed
for
two
nights
is
likely
to
die
wilkinson
showed
that
the
blood
donors
are
typically
sharing
their
surpluses
and
in
so
doing
are
saving
unsuccessful
foragers
that
are
close
to
starvation
so
the
costs
are
relatively
low
and
the
benefits
are
relatively
high
since
no
bat
can
be
certain
of
success
on
any
given
night
it
is
likely
that
the
donor
will
itself
eventually
need
help
from
some
nest
mate
in
effect
the
vampire
bats
have
created
a
kind
of
one
of
the
little
understood
paradoxes
in
communication
is
that
the
more
difficult
the
word
the
shorter
the
explanation
the
more
meaning
you
can
pack
into
a
single
word
the
fewer
words
are
needed
to
get
the
idea
across
big
words
are
resented
by
persons
who
don
understand
them
and
of
course
very
often
they
are
used
to
confuse
and
impress
rather
than
clarify
but
this
is
not
the
fault
of
language
it
is
the
arrogance
of
the
individual
who
misuses
the
tools
of
communication
the
best
reason
for
acquiring
a
large
vocabulary
is
that
a
genuinely
educated
person
can
express
himself
tersely
and
trimly
for
example
if
you
don
know
or
use
the
word
imbricate 
you
have
to
say
to
someone
having
the
edges
overlapping
in
a
regular
arrangement
like
tiles
on
a
roof
scales
on
a
fish
or
sepals
on
a
plant 
more
than
words
to
say
what
can
be
said
in
one
so
far
as
you
are
wholly
concentrated
on
bringing
about
a
certain
result
clearly
the
quicker
and
easier
it
is
brought
about
the
better
your
resolve
to
secure
a
sufficiency
of
food
for
yourself
and
your
family
will
induce
you
to
spend
weary
days
in
tilling
the
ground
and
tending
livestock
but
if
nature
provided
food
and
meat
in
abundance
ready
for
the
table
you
would
thank
nature
for
sparing
you
much
labor
and
consider
yourself
so
much
the
better
off
an
executed
purpose
in
short
is
a
transaction
in
which
the
time
and
energy
spent
on
the
execution
are
balanced
against
the
resulting
assets
and
the
ideal
case
is
one
in
which
purpose
then
justifies
the
efforts
it
exacts
only
conditionally
by
their
fruits
the
time
and
energy
are
limitless
and
assets
are
abundant
the
former
approximates
to
zero
and
the
latter
to
infinity
psychologist
solomon
asch
wanted
to
discover
whether
people
tendency
to
agree
with
their
peers
was
stronger
than
their
tendency
toward
independent
thought
and
rational
judgment
asch
assembled
groups
of
twelve
university
students
and
announced
that
they
were
taking
part
in
an
experiment
on
visual
perception
he
showed
them
three
line
segments
and
asked
each
one
in
turn
which
line
was
the
longest
it
was
an
easy
task
and
the
correct
answer
was
obvious
however
asch
had
secretly
instructed
all
but
the
last
person
in
each
group
who
was
the
real
subject
of
the
experiment
to
say
that
the
medium
length
line
was
the
longest
as
it
turned
out
over
percent
of
the
real
subjects
and
said
that
the

was
the

journeys
are
the
midwives
of
thought
few
places
are
more
conducive
to
internal
conversations
than
a
moving
plane
ship
or
train
there
is
an
almost
peculiar
correlation
between
what
is
in
front
of
our
eyes
and
the
thoughts
we
are
able
to
have
in
our
heads
large
thoughts
at
times
requiring
large
views
new
thoughts
new
places
introspective
reflections
which
are
liable
to
stall
are
helped
along
by
the
flow
of
the
landscape
the
mind
when
thinking
is
all
it
is
supposed
to
do
the
task
can
be
as
paralyzing
as
having
to
tell
a
joke
or
mimic
an
accent
on
demand
thinking
improves
when
parts
of
the
mind
are
given
other
tasks
are
charged
with
listening
to
music
or
following
a
line
of
trees
it
is
a
fundamental
mistake
to
imagine
that
when
we
see
the
non
value
in
a
value
or
the
untruth
in
a
truth
the
value
or
the
truth
ceases
to
exist
it
has
only
become
relative
everything
human
is
relative
because
everything
rests
on
an
inner
polarity
for
everything
is
a
phenomenon
of
energy
energy
necessarily
depends
on
a
pre
existing
polarity
without
which
there
could
be
no
energy
there
must
always
be
high
and
low
hot
and
cold
etc
so
that
the
equilibrating
process
which
is
energy
can
take
place
therefore
the
tendency
to
deny
all
previous
values
in
favor
of
their
opposites
is
just
and
in
so
far
as
it
is
a
question
of
rejecting
universally
accepted
and
indubitable
values
the
result
is
a
fatal
loss
jess
took
another
step
forward
the

fell
with
unexpected
sharpness

the
water
level

to
jump
from

a
moment

anxiously
scanned

her
her

she

stiffen

this
was

didn

swept

to
what
we
usually
believe
the
best
moments
in

lives
are
not

passive
receptive

times

such
experiences
can
also
be
enjoyable

as
a
filter
to
separate
the
essential
from
the
irrelevant
when
that
filter
mistakenly
screens
out
something
essential
then
even
seasoned
masters
can
make
mistakes
you
see
the
world
as
one
big
contest
where
everyone
is
competing
against
everybody
else
you
feel
that
there
is
a
set
amount
of
good
and
bad
fortune
out
there
you
believe
that
there
is
no
way
that
everyone
can
have
everything
when
other
people
fail
you
feel
there
a
better
chance
for
you
to
succeed
however
there
is
not
a
limited
supply
of
resources
out
there
when
one
person
wins
everyone
wins
every
victory
one
person
makes
is
a
breakthrough
for
all
whenever
an
olympic
swimmer
sets
a
new
world
record
it
inspires
others
to
bring
out
the
best
within
them
and
go
beyond
that
achievement
to
set
new
records
of
human
performance
whenever
a
geneticist
unlocks
new
secrets
of
the
dna
molecule
it
adds
to
our
knowledge
base
and
enables
us
to
better
the
human
condition
remember
that
life
is
a
game
where
there
are
multiple
winners
university
students
in
several
of
my
seminar
classes
sat
in
a
circle
and
each
student
took
turns
telling
the
others
his
or
her
name
at
the
end
of
the
round
of
introductions
the
students
were
asked
to
write
down
the
names
of
as
many
other
students
as
they
could
remember
in
almost
every
case
students
wrote
down
the
names
of
students
that
were
seated
far
away
from
them
however
surprisingly
they
weren
able
to
recall
the
names
of
students
who
were
seated
close
to
them
this
effect
was
worst
for
the
students
who
sat
on
either
side
of
them
what
was
the
reason
for
such
findings
the
student
who
was
next
in
line
for
an
introduction
was
clearly
on
edge
and
after
finishing
his
or
her
introduction
he
or
she
was
preoccupied
with
calming
his
or
her
nerves
the
effect
was
clearly
due
to
the
social
anxiety
they
experienced
immediately
before
and
after
having
to
introduce
themselves
to
the
entire
group
richard
dawkins
and
john
krebs
argued
that
although
in
some
circumstances
it
might
be
appropriate
to
describe
animal
signals
as
transferring
information
in
many
other
perhaps
most
cases
there
would
be
such
a
conflict
of
interest
between
signaller
and
receiver
that
it
is
more
accurate
to
describe
the
signaller
as
attempting
to
manipulate
the
receiver
rather
than
just
inform
it
for
example
an
angler
fish
that
dangles
a
worm
like
bit
of
skin
in
front
of
a
small
fish
and
catches
it
because
the
smaller
fish
snaps
at
the
worm
can
certainly
be
said
to
have
carried
out
a
successful
manipulation
of
its
prey
in
this
case
if
information
has
been
transferred
it
is
most
definitely
FALSE
the
body
has
been
viewed
as
a
natural
phenomenon
a
fixed
unchanging
fact
of
nature
recently
however
it
is
also
being
seen
as
a
part
of
culture
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
socially
defined
in
different
ways
a
it
has
also
opened
up
new
questions
and
issues
in
the
sociology
of
sport
some
people
in
the
sociology
of
sport
are
now
working
with
colleagues
in
other
disciplines
who
share
interests
in
the
body
b
social
definitions
of
the
body
are
grounded
in
social
relations
and
influenced
by
those
with
the
power
to
promote
agreement
about
what
should
be
considered
natural
when
it
comes
to
the
body
this
new
way
of
thinking
about
the
body
has
challenged
the
traditional
mind
body
split
that
has
characterized
western
thought
since
the
time
of
plato
c
in
their
work
they
are
asking
critical
questions
about
how
the
body
is
trained
disciplined
and
manipulated
in
sports
and
how
some
sport
scientists
are
using
technology
to
probe
monitor
test
evaluate
and
rehabilitate
the
body
as
a
performance
machine
why
eat
a
cookie
some
reasons
might
be
to
satisfy
your
hunger
to
increase
your
sugar
level
or
just
to
have
something
to
chew
on
it
appears
that
cookie
producing
companies
are
becoming
aware
of
some
other
influences
and
as
a
result
are
delivering
to
the
market
products
resulting
from
their
awareness
these
relatively
new
product
offerings
are
usually
referred
to
as
soft
or
chewy
cookies
to
distinguish
them
from
the
more
typical
crunchy
varieties
why
all
the
fuss
over
their
introduction
apparently
much
of
their
appeal
has
to
do
with
childhood
memories
of
sitting
on
the
back
steps
devouring
those
melt
in
your
mouth
cookies
that
were
delivered
by
mom
straight
from
the
oven
while
they
were
still
soft
this
emotional
and
sensory
appeal
of
soft
cookies
is
apparently
at
least
as
strong
as
are
the
physical
cravings
that
the
product
satisfies
unlike
the
modern
society
the
primitive
society
has
less
specialized
knowledge
to
transmit
and
since
its
way
of
life
is
enacted
before
the
eyes
of
all
it
has
no
need
to
create
a
separate
institution
of
education
such
as
the
school
instead
the
child
acquires
the
heritage
of
his
culture
by
observing
and
imitating
adults
in
such
activities
as
rituals
hunts
festivals
cultivation
and
harvesting
as
a
result
there
is
little
or
none
of
that
alienation
of
young
from
old
so
marked
in
modern
industrial
societies
a
further
reason
for
this
alienation
in
modern
societies
is
that
in
his
conception
of
reality
the
modern
adult
owes
less
to
his
direct
experience
and
more
to
the
experience
of
his
culture
than
does
primitive
man
clearly
his
debt
to
culture
will
vary
with
the
nature
of
his
education
hence
the
contemporary
child
must
travel
much
further
than
the
offspring
of
primitive
man
to
acquire
the
world
view
of
his
elders
he
is
therefore
that
much
more
removed
from
the
adults
of
his
society
unlike
the
primitive
child
who
learns
from
his
a
surroundings
the
modern
child
learns
in
educational
institutions
which
results
in
b
from
his
elders
many
people
believe
that
it
is
critical
to
share
similar
if
not
identical
beliefs
and
values
with
someone
with
whom
they
have
a
relationship

this
may
seem

it

her

at
that
moment
a
sudden
inspiration
took
hold
this
in
the
simplest
definition
is
a
promise
enforceable
by
law
the
promise
may
be
to
do
something
or
to
stop
from
doing
something
the
making
of
this
requires
the
mutual
agreement
of
two
or
more
persons
or
parties
one
of
them
ordinarily
making
an
offer
and
another
accepting
if
one
of
the
parties
fails
to
keep
the
promise
the
other
has
rights
to
compensation
the
law
about
this
considers
such
questions
as
whether
this
exists
what
the
meaning
of
this
is
whether
this
has
been
broken
and
what
compensation
is
due
to
the
injured
party
it
was
a
beautiful
friday
afternoon
and
the
weekend
was
about
to
begin
but
rob
had
a
lot
on
his
mind
he
had
been
putting
off
doing
his
chemistry
report
which
was
due
on
monday
after
borrowing
some
books
from
the
library
he
went
home
later
that
evening
he
was
doing
the
assignment
when
his
father
came
in
what
are
you
doing
kid
he
asked
biography
of
marie
curie
rob
said
absently
as
he
was
typing
on
his
computer
really
i
did
that
for
a

assignment
when
i
was
in
school
his
father
said
why
don
you
find
some
information
from
the
encyclopedia
over
there
he
added
rob
grabbed
the
encyclopedia
he
smiled
thinking
that
even
though
he
was
practically
born
playing
computer
games
he
was
still
doing
the
same
assignments
his
father
did
over
years
ago
upon
receiving
your
last
letter
i
rushed
to
look
up
the
word
flattering
in
the
dictionary
i
was
shocked
to
find
out
that
it
could
imply
something
negative
which
i
certainly
did
not
mean
i
should
have
used
some
word
like
complimentary
instead
for
that
i
would
like
to
ask
for
the
kindness
in
your
heart
to
forgive
my
unintended
offense
if
you
knew
me
well
you
would
know
that
i
am
shameless
enough
to
take
all
compliments
at
their
face
value
and
not
to
think
that
they
might
be
mere
flattery
i
just
did
not
know
what
the
word
really
implied
i
hope
that
you
no
longer
feel
hurt
or
uncomfortable
in
any
way
as
a
result
of
our
correspondence
while
awaiting
the
birth
of
a
new
baby
north
american
parents
typically
furnish
a
room
as
the
infant
sleeping
quarters
for
decades
child
rearing
advice
from
experts
has
a
encouraged
been
encouraged
the
nighttime
separation
of
baby
from
parent
for
example
a
study
recommends
that
babies
be
moved
into
their
own
room
by
three
months
of
age
by
six
months
a
child
b
who
whom
regularly
sleeps
in
her
parents
room
is
likely
to
become
dependent
on
this
arrangement
reports
the
study
yet
parent
infant
co
sleeping
is
the
norm
for
approximately
percent
of
the
world
population
cultures
as
c
diverse
diversely
as
the
japanese
the
guatemalan
maya
and
the
inuit
of
northwestern
canada
practice
it
while
manned
space
missions
are
more
costly
than
unmanned
ones
they
are
more
successful
robots
and
astronauts
use
much
of
the
same
equipment
in
space
but
a
human
is
much
more
capable
of
operating
those
instruments
correctly
and
to
place
them
in
appropriate
and
useful
positions
rarely
is
a
computer
more
sensitive
and
accurate
than
a
human
in
managing
the
same
geographical
or
environmental
factors
robots
are
also
not
equipped
with
capabilities
like
humans
to
solve
problems
as
they
arise
and
they
often
collect
data
that
are
unhelpful
or
irrelevant
most
of
you
experience
urges
when
trying
to
break
a
habit
and
these
can
be
hard
to
resist
unless
you
find
something
else
to
do
instead
and
best
of
all
something
that
uses
the
same
part
of
the
body
even
the
same
muscles
if
the
habit
involves
your
hands
as
when
pulling
out
hair
then
try
to
occupy
them
in
some
other
way
playing
with
a
toy
or
opening
and
closing
your
fists
for
a
couple
of
minutes
might
be
an
answer
the
habit
of
scratching
can
be
replaced
with
rubbing
in
some
lotion
or
patting
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
if
the
itches
however
do
not
disappear
stop
scratching
and
take
the
medicine
one
year
old
woman
who
used
to
rub
her
eyes
with
her
hands
until
they
became
sore
and
infected
found
it
helpful
to
put
on
make
up
when
she
was
tempted
to
rub
in
this
modern
world
people
are
not
used
to
living
with
discomfort
we
expect
immediate
results
and
satisfaction
we
want
answers
faster
than
they
can
be
delivered
there
is
twenty
four
hour
repair
and
round
the
clock
shopping
if
we
are
hungry
there
is
always
food
available
from
microwave
dinners
to
all
night
grocery
stores
and
restaurants
people
no
longer
know
how
to
wait
or
even
what
waiting
means
it
is
nice
to
have
what
you
want
when
you
want
it
but
the
ability
to
delay
satisfaction
is
important
is
clearly
an
important
virtue
yet
so
many
people
stand
in
front
of
their
microwaves
thinking
hurry
up
the
goal
of
medicine
as
it
is
currently
practiced
is
to
develop
procedures
and
drugs
that
work
equally
well
on
all
patients
regardless
of
gender
age
or
genetics
it
derives
from
the
prevalent
belief
that
all
of
us
are
similar
bio
mechanical
units
that
rolled
off
the
same
assembly
line
a
most
imperfect
conception
of
human
beings
that
limits
conventional
medicine
effectiveness
the
doctor
of
the
future
however
needs
to
practice
medicine
in
fundamentally
different
ways
one
of
the
most
important
shifts
will
be
an
increased
recognition
of
a
concept
now
largely
ignored
instead
of
treating
different
patients
that
display
similar
symptoms
with
the
same
drugs
doctors
should
identify
root
causes
of
disease
to
come
up
with
a
personalized
treatment
for
the
most
part
we
like
things
that
are
familiar
to
us
to
prove
the
point
to
yourself
try
a
little
experiment
get
the
negative
of
an
old
photograph
that
shows
a
front
view
of
your
face
and
have
it
developed
into
a
pair
of
pictures
one
that
shows
you
as
you
actually
look
and
one
that
shows
a
reverse
image
so
that
the
right
and
left
sides
of
your
face
are
interchanged
now
decide
which
version
of
your
face
you
like
better
and
ask
a
good
friend
to
make
the
choice
too
if
you
are
like
most
people
you
should
notice
something
odd
your
friend
will
prefer
the
TRUE
print
but
you
will
prefer
the
reverse
image
why
because
you
both
will
be
responding
favorably
to
the
more
familiar
face
your
friend
to
and
you
to
the
reversed
one
you
find
in
the
mirror
every
day
the
human
auditory
system
a
psychologist
named
richard
warren
demonstrated
this
particularly
well
he
recorded
a
sentence
and
cut
out
a
piece
of
the
sentence
from
the
recording
tape
he
replaced
the
missing
piece
with
a
burst
of
static
of
the
same
duration
nearly
everyone
who
heard
the
altered
recording
could
report
that
they
heard
both
a
sentence
and
static
but
a
majority
of
people
could
not
tell
where
the
static
was
the
auditory
system
had
filled
in
the
missing
speech
information
so
that
the
sentence
seemed
uninterrupted
most
people
reported
that
there
was
static
and
that
it
existed
apart
from
the
spoken
sentence
the
static
and
the
sentence
formed
separate
perceptual
streams
due
to
differences
in
the
quality
of
sound
that
caused
them
to
group
separately
not
all
authors
trusted
that
the
theater
audience
would
automatically
understand
their
plays
in
the
intended
manner
thus
they
repeatedly
attempted
to
make
it
clear
to
their
public
that
visiting
the
theater
was
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
entertainment
but
rather
to
draw
lessons
from
the
play
offered
onstage
it
was
therefore
important
for
the
viewer
so
as
to
facilitate
interpretation
of
the
content
this
idea
was
developed
by
bertolt
brecht
with
his
epic
theater 
which
used
alienation
as
a
strategy
to
prevent
the
identification
of
the
public
with
the
figures
of
the
drama
through
scattered
narration
and
commentary
throughout
the
play
for
example
the
viewers
are
invited
to
take
a
step
back
from
the
performance
in
this
way
they
are
given
hints
to
better
understand
the
play
while
the
conclusion
is
left
open
so
as
to
leave
them
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
after
dinner
he
built
a
fire
going
out
into
the

for
wood
he
had
piled
against
the
garage
the
air
was
bright
and
cold
against
his
face
and
the
snow
in
the
driveway
was
already
halfway
to
his
knees
he
gathered
logs
shaking
off
their
soft
white
caps
and
carrying
them
inside
he
sat
for
a
time
in

the

responses
to
survey
questions
are
influenced
by
events
and
we
should
consider
this
when
reviewing
the
results
of
a
survey
the
reputation
of
an
airline
for
example
will
be
a
damaged
recovered
if
a
survey
is
conducted
just
after
a
plane
crash
a
computer
company
lost
its
reputation
in
company
surveys
just
after
major
news
coverage
about
a
defect
in
its
products
on
the
positive
side
surveys
by
a
beverage
company
about
its
image
showed
very
b
hostile
favorable
public
attitudes
just
after
its
massive
investment
in
the
olympics
consequently
surveys
should
be
conducted
when
the
organization
is
not
in
the
news
or
connected
to
a
significant
event
that
may
influence
public
opinion
in
neutral
context
a
more
c
valid
biased
survey
can
be
conducted
about
an
organization
reputation
products
or
services
war
seems
to
be
part
of
the
history
of
humanity
countries
regions
and
even
villages
were
economically
independent
of
one
another
in
the
past
under
those
circumstances
the
destruction
of
our
enemy
might
have
been
a
victory
for
us
there
was
a
relevance
to
violence
and
war
a
today
we
are
so
interdependent
that
the
concept
of
war
has
become
outdated
when
we
face
problems
or
disagreements
today
we
have
to
arrive
at
solutions
through
dialog
we
must
work
to
resolve
conflicts
in
a
spirit
of
reconciliation
and
always
keep
in
mind
the
interests
of
others
we
cannot
destroy
our
neighbors
we
cannot
ignore
their
interests
doing
so
would
ultimately
cause
us
to
suffer
b
the
concept
of
violence
is
now
unsuitable
and
nonviolence
is
the
appropriate
method
imagine
that
you
are
in
a
meeting
your
party
and
the
other
party
are
sitting
across
a
table
you
ask
a
question
on
a
particular
subject
and
the
answer
is
unsatisfactory
what
would
be
the
best
response
it
is
none
at
all
so
if
you
are
seeking
more
information
or
a
different
kind
of
information
ask
for
it
by
remaining
silent
when
there
is
a
long
pause
in
the
conversation
people
feel
an
overwhelming
need
to
fill
it
if
someone
has
finished
speaking
and
you
do
not
play
along
by
taking
up
your
end
of
the
dialog
that
person
will
automatically
start
to
elaborate
eventually
they
may
say
what
you
want
to
hear

such
as

starting
in
the
s
people
began
flooding
into
chattanooga
a
former
factory
town
to
explore
its
caves
rivers
and
cliffs
before
long
more
than
caves
surrounding
the
city
had
been
discovered
the
nearby
ocoee
was
among
the
most
paddled
rivers
in
the
country
and
six
major
climbing
sites
sprang
up
within
an
hour
drive
of
city
limits
but
in
spite
of
this
boundless
outdoors
potential
there
remained
the
problem
of
chattanooga
proper
a
post
industrial
wasteland
that
made
the
city
the
kind
of
place
you
would
visit
but
would
never
want
to
live
in
not
that
is
until
lately
over
the
past
decade
chattanooga
has
made
an
incredible
urban
comeback
electric
buses
organic
markets
and
a
million
dollar
riverfront
restoration
project
completed
last
year
in
addition
beautiful
modern
architecture
such
as
the
post
modern
museum
and
the
newly
remodeled
aquarium
plays
a
big
role
in
the
comeback
of
chattanooga
in
practical
situations
where
there
is
no
room
for
error
we
have
learned
to
avoid
vagueness
in
communication
a
fire
chief
for
example
needs
to
issue
his
orders
with
absolute
clarity
in
imaginative
situations
however
there
is
the
danger
that
too
much
specificity
can
limit
your
imagination
let
suppose
that
the
same
fire
chief
has
asked
you
to
paint
a
picture
on
the
side
of
his
firehouse
if
he
tells
you
what
he
wants
it
to
look
like
right
down
to
the
last
detail
he
has
not
given
you
any
room
for
your
imagination
however
if
the
assignment
were
stated
somewhat
vaguely
then
you
would
have
more
room
to
think
and
be
more
creative
although
a
speech
can
be
effective
all
the
words
in
the
world
cannot
measure
up
to
the
example
of
a
leader
especially
in
communicating
new
behaviors
and
values
there
is
often
no
more
effective
way
to
help
people
understand
the
message
than
to
have
it
modeled
for
them
by
the
manager
words
can
yield
a
variety
of
interpretations
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
behaviors
people
think
they
mean
but
a
manager
actions
provide
a
clear
model
of
exactly
the
kind
of
behavior
required
managers
who
want
people
to
take
a
more
team
based
approach
with
their
people
for
example
will
almost
certainly
get
better
results
by
taking
a
more
team
based
approach
themselves
rather
than
just
by
making
a
speech
on
teamwork
now
as
always
cities
are
desperate
to
create
the
impression
that
they
lie
at
the
center
of
something
or
other
this
idea
of
centrality
may
be
locational
namely
that
a
city
lies
at
the
geographical
center
of
england
europe
and
so
on
this
draws
on
a
well
established
notion
that
geographical
centrality
makes
a
place
more
accessible
easing
communication
and
communication
costs
cultural
centrality
usually
demonstrates
itself
as
a
cry
that
a
city
is
at
the
center
of
the
action
this
means
that
the
city
has
an
abundance
of
cultural
activities
such
as
restaurants
theater
ballet
music
sport
and
scenery
the
suggestion
is
that
people
will
want
for
nothing
in
this
city
a
young
children
rarely
think
of
their
art
as
personal
property
often
they
throw
it
away
or
give
it
away
this
suggests
that
much
of
the
value
of
art
for
a
child
consists
in
making
it
interestingly
art
in
tribal
societies
is
frequently
abandoned
after
it
has
served
its
purpose
the
focus
is
on
the
magical
expressive
and
social
value
of
the
act
of
making
some
contemporary
artists
share
this
feeling
but
they
are
also
caught
up
in
the
system
of

this

not
without
its

one
of
the
more
amusing
aspects
of
this
age
is
the
child
often
vivid
imagination
expressed
most
strikingly
in
his
enjoyment
of
imaginary
companions
though
some
people
have
felt
that
only
the
lonely
play
with
imaginary
playmates
our
research
makes
it
very
evident
that
it
is
often
the
highly
superior
and
imaginative
child
who
invents
these
creatures
they
are
very
real
to
him
very
important
and
we
can
assure
you
quite
harmless

it
may
be
annoying

have
to

keep
an
extra

for
his

who
exists
only
in

it

probably
well

rosalyn
parents
did
everything
possible
to
avoid
favoring
one
child
over
the
others
and
this
resulted
in
her
feelings
being
hurt
one
year
rosalyn
asked
her
mother
to
prepare
a
special
treat
for
her
birthday
the
honey
cake
that
rosalyn
had
always
loved
a
upon
receiving
the
cake
rosalyn
became
disappointed
it
was
after
all
her
birthday
couldn
she
be
singled
out
on
one
day
of
the
year
a
parent
admirable
efforts
not
to
play
favorites
can
mean
that
no
child
gets
the
whole
cake
of
parental
love
b
her
mother
said
she
couldn
if
she
made
a
honey
cake
for
rosalyn
she
have
to
make
cakes
for
rosalyn
two
sisters
and
she
didn
have
time
to
make
three
cakes
c
in
the
end
her
mother
did
give
rosalyn
a
honey
cake
on
her
birthday
a
really
small
one
because
she
split
the
batter
for
one
cake
into

equally
how
can
you
create
closeness
when
the
two
of
you
are
hundreds
of
miles
apart
how
can
you
make
the
person
you
are
talking
to
on
the
phone
feel
special
when
you
cannot
pat
their
back
or
give
them
a
little
hug
the
answer
is
simple
just
use
your
caller
name
far
more
often
than
you
would
in
person
in
fact
shower
your
conversations
with
his
or
her
name
saying
a
person
name
too
often
in
face
to
face
conversation
sounds
manipulative
however
on
the
phone
the
effect
is
dramatically
different
if
you
heard
someone
say
your
name
even
if
you
were
being
pushed
around
in
a
big
noisy
crowd
you
would
pay
attention
and
listen

psychologists
performed
an
experiment
in
which
they
put
a
number
of
people
in

set
it
was
one
of
those
children
toys
with
a
short
wooden
post
held
upright
on
the
floor
and
a
bunch
of
round
rings
the
subjects
were
left
alone
to
amuse
themselves
as
best
they
could
as
expected
with
time
to
kill
they
began
trying
to
toss
the
rings
around
the
post
what
the
psychologists
discovered
was
that
most
of
the
people
moved
far
enough
away
from
the
post
so
that
tossing
the
rings
around
it
was
challenging
but
not
so
difficult
as
to
be
totally
frustrating
in
other
words
they
deliberately
positioned
themselves
between
frustration
on
the
one
hand
and
boredom
on
the
other
the
process
of
alternately
producing
and
relieving
tension
was
what
made
the
activity
stimulating
subjects
tended
to
make
a
ring
toss
activity
stimulating
by
producing
just
enough

varying
the
distance

flying
over

kansas
in

one
fall
evening
was
a
delightful
experience
for
passenger
walt
morris
he
watched
the
twinkling
farmhouse
lights
below
suddenly
the
peace
of
the
evening
was
broken
when
the
plane
landing
lights
started
flashing
on
and
off
what
happening 
he
wondered
as
he
gripped
the
armrests
as
the
pilot
was
about
to
make
an
announcement
he
thought
this
is
it
he
going
to
tell
us
we
got
a
major
problem 
instead
he
told
the
passengers
in
case
you
worried
about
the
flashing
lights
outside
the
plane
i
sending
a
signal
to
my
kids
he
was
relieved
to
hear
the
continued
announcement
they
at
home
over
on
that
hill
to
the

they
just
sent
me
a

saying
good
night
dad 
if
you
are
worrying
about
money
when
you
are
away
your
enjoyment
will
suffer
plan
your
budget
in
advance
to
give
yourself
time
to
research
the
costs
fully
if
you
cannot
get
confirmed
prices
get
as
many
estimates
as
you
can
note
the
best
price
and
the
worst
price
and
budget
in
between
the
two
ideally
the
budgeted
figures
will
work
out
just
about
right
if
they
don
you
will
have
to
use
your
emergency
fund
to
cover
basic
expenses
such
as
food
transport
and
accommodation
and
there
will
be
less
money
available
for
an
unexpected
situation
that
necessitates
a
sudden
change
of
plan
so
be
sure
to
make
your
budget
realistic
so
that
you
can
be
confident
that
you
will
be
able
to
pay
for
all
aspects
of
the
trip
many
social
scientists
have
believed
for
some
time
a
that
what
birth
order
directly
affects
both
personality
and
achievement
in
adult
life
in
fact
people
have
been
using
birth
order
to
account
for
personality
factors
such
as
an
aggressive
behavior
or
a
passive
temperament
one
might
say
oh
i
the
eldest
of
three
sisters
so
i
can
help
that
i
so
overbearing
or
i
not
very
successful
in
business
because
i
the
youngest
child
and
thus
less
b
aggressively
aggressive
than
my
older
brothers
and
sisters
recent
studies
however
have
proved
this
belief
to
be
FALSE
in
other
words
birth
order
may
define
your
role
within
a
family
but
as
you
mature
into
adulthood
c
accepted
acceptingother
social
roles
birth
order
becomes
insignificant
you
may
think
that
moving
a
short
distance
is
so
easy
that
you
can
do
it
in
no
time
with
little
effort
you
may
decide
to
use
your
own
car
because
you
think
that
you
don
need
the
services
of
a
moving
company
well
you
might
be
wrong
you
are
under
the
FALSE
impression
that
you
do
not
have
as
many
items
to
pack
as
you
really
do
you
find
out
too
late
that
your
car
cannot
carry
as
much
as
you
thought
it
could
so
it
takes
you
far
more
trips
to
your
new
home
than
you
thought
it
would
there
is
also
the
possibility
of
damage
your
stuff
some
of
it
valuable
all
these
things
considered
it
might
be
better
to
ask
for
the
services
of
a
moving
company
roman
doll
makers
continued
to
use
technology
developed
by
the
egyptians
and
greeks
but
in
line
with
the
artistic
sensibilities
of
their
culture
they
were
constantly
trying
to
make
dolls
more
elegant
and
beautiful
one
doll
found
near
prati
in
rome
was
made
of
ivory
and
lay
beside
her
owner
who
had
died
at
the
age
of
eighteen
the
huge
growth
in
the
understanding
of
civilization
raised
awareness
of
other
important
roles
of
trade
next
to
the
doll
was
a
small
box
also
made
of
ivory
containing
tiny
combs
and
a
silver
mirror
the
doll
had
rings
on
her
fingers
and
held
a
tiny
key
which
unlocked
the
box
like
children
today
the
younger
members
of
roman
civilization
would
have
dressed
and
undressed
their
dolls
and
decorated
their
hair
and
fingers
according
to
the
latest
fashions
while
the
fine
art
object
is
valued
because
it
is
unique
it
is
also
valued
because
it
can
be
reproduced
for
for
example
van
gogh
paintings
have
been
reproduced
endlessly
on
posters
postcards
coffee
mugs
and
t
shirts
ordinary
consumers
can
own
a
copy
of
the
highly
valued
originals
therefore
the
value
of
the
original
results
not
only
from
its
uniqueness
but
from
its
being
the
source
from
which
reproductions
are
made
the
manufacturers
who
produce
art
reproductions
and
the
consumers
who
purchase
and
display
them
give
value
to
the
work
of
art
by
making
it
available
to
many
people
as
an
item
of
popular
culture
there
are
some
people
who
believe
that
no
one
should
be
trusted
they
usually
feel
this
way
because
their
behavior
compels
others
to
lie
to
them
in
other
words
they
make
it
difficult
for
others
to
tell
them
the
truth
because
they
respond
rudely
or
emotionally
to
people
who
tell
the
truth
if
others
see
how
angry
hurt
or
hateful
you
become
when
they
tell
you
the
truth
they
will
avoid
telling
it
to
you
at
all
costs
if
you
are
known
as
someone
who
is
easily
offended
you
will
never
know
what
others
are
really
thinking
or
feeling
because
they
will
to
escape
from
your
negative
reaction
if
you
demand
that
children
tell
you
the
truth
and
then
punish
them
because
it
is
not
very
satisfying
you
teach
them
to
lie
to
you
to
protect
themselves
one
of
the
main
principles
i
follow
when
i
draw
outside
is
i
try
to
stay
away
from
houses
or
barns
that
have
unusual
angles
of
the
roof
or
objects
that
look
incorrect
in
size
perspective
or
design
if
the
subject
is
confusing
when
you
look
at
it
it
will
be
more
confusing
when
you
attempt
to
draw
it
i
know
a
beautiful
barn
where
the
corners
are
not
at
right
angles
no
matter
how
many
times
i
have
drawn
it
the
perspective
does
not
look
right
if
i
were
to
make
an
accurate
drawing
of
this
barn
and
put
it
in
a
show
i
sure
i
would
get
all
kinds
of
criticism
for
my
poor
perspective
i
would
not
be
there
to
tell
my
critics
that
the
barn
is
actually
constructed
this
way
so
i
stay
away
from
subjects
that
do
not
look
right
to
me
when
faced
with
things
that
are
too
big
to
sense
we
comprehend
them
by
the
first
appearance
of
a
shining
star
in
a
darkening
evening
sky
can
take
you
out
into
the
universe
if
you
combine
what
you
see
with
the
twin
facts
that
the
star
is
merely
one
of
the
closest
of
the
galaxy
billion
stars
and
that
its
light
began
traveling
decades
ago
the
smell
of
gasoline
going
into
a
car
tank
during
a
refueling
stop
when
combined
with
the
fact
that
each
day
nearly
a
billion
gallons
of
crude
oil
are
refined
and
used
in
the
united
states
can
allow
our
imagination
to
spread
outward
into
the
vast
global
network
of
energy
trade
and
politics
the
first
experiments
in
television
broadcasting
began
in
france
in
the
s
but
the
french
were
slow
to
employ
the
new
technology
there
were
several
reasons
for
this
a
hesitancy
consistency
radio
absorbed
the
majority
of
state
resources
and
the
french
government
was
reluctant
to
shoulder
the
financial
burden
of
developing
national
networks
for
television
broadcasting
television
programming
costs
were
too
high
and
program
output
correspondingly
low
poor
b
distribution
description
combined
with
minimal
offerings
provided
little
incentive
to
purchase
the
new
product
further
television
sets
were
priced
beyond
the
means
of
a
general
public
whose
modest
living
standards
especially
in
the
s
and
s
did
not
allow
the
acquisition
of
luxury
goods
ideological
influences
also
factored
in
elites
in
particular
were
c
optimistic
skeptical
of
television
perceiving
it
as
a
messenger
of
mass
culture
and
americanization
a
violin
creates
tension
in
its
strings
and
gives
each
of
them
an
equilibrium
shape
a
straight
line
a
tight
violin
string
can
be
viewed
as
composed
of
many
individual
pieces
that
are
connected
in
a
chain
as
in
the
above
two
figures
when
the
string
is
straight
as
in
figure
its
tension
is
uniform
and
the
two
outward
forces
on
a
given
piece
sum
to
zero
they
have
equal
magnitudes
and
point
in
opposite
directions
with
no
net
forces
acting
on
its
pieces
the
string
is
in
equilibrium
but
when
the
string
is
curved
as
in
figure
the
outward
forces
on
its
pieces
no
longer
sum
to
zero
although
the
string
uniform
tension
still
gives
those
outward
forces
equal
magnitudes
they
now
point
inslightly
different
directions
and
each
piece
experiences
a
zero
net
force
the
net
forces
on
its
pieces
are
restoring
forces
which
will
cause
the
string
to
vibrate
and
thus
make
sounds
her
nerves
were
hurting
her
she
looked
automatically
again
at
the
high
uncurtained
windows
as

fell
she
could
just
perceive
outside
a
huge
tree
swinging
its
branches
the
rain
came
flying
on
the
window
ah
why
didn
she
have
peace
these
two
men
her
husband
and
her

why
did
they
not
come
she
wrapped
a
large
scarf
around
her
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
she
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
backyard
there
was
no
sign
of
a
light
anywhere
she
listened
with
all
her
ears
but
could
hear
nothing
but
the

sheets
of
paper
exist
almost
entirely
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
information
so
we
tend
to
think
of
them
as
neutral
objects
we
rarely
interpret
marks
on
paper
as
references
to
the
paper
itself
a
when
we
see
the
text
characters
and
images
on
artifacts
that
serve
other
purposes
we
generally
interpret
these
marks
as
labels
that
do
refer
to
their
carriers
natural
objects
do
not
come
with
labels
of
course
but
these
days
most
physical
artifacts
do
b
their
designers
have
chosen
to
shift
part
of
the
burden
of
communication
from
the
form
and
materials
of
the
artifact
itself
to
lightweight
surface
symbols
so
for
example
a
designer
of
door
handles
might
not
worry
about
communicating
their
functions
through
their
shapes
but
might
simply
mark
them
push
and
pull 
many
people
believe
that
they
will
be
free
of
their
anger
if
they
express
it
and
that
their
tears
will
release
their
pain
this
belief
derives
from
a
nineteenth
century
understanding
of
emotions
and
it
is
no
truer
than
the
flat
earth
it
sees
the
brain
as
a
steam
kettle
in
which
negative
feelings
build
up
pressure
but
no
psychologist
has
ever
succeeded
in
proving
the
unburdening
effects
of
the
supposed
safety
valves
of
tears
and
anger
on
the
contrary
over
forty
years
ago
controlled
studies
showed
that
fits
of
anger
are
more
likely
to
intensify
anger
and
that
tears
can
drive
us
still
deeper
into
depression
our
heads
do
not
resemble
steam
kettles
and
our
brains
involve
a
much
more
complicated
system
than
can
be
accounted
for
by
images
taken
from
nineteenth
century
technology
knowing
when
something
happened
is
important
understanding
why
historic
events
took
place
is
also
important
to
do
this
historians
often
turn
to
geography
weather
patterns
the
water
supply
and
the
landscape
of
a
place
all
affect
the
lives
of
the
people
who
live
there
for
example
to
explain
why
the
ancient
egyptians
developed
a
successful
civilization
you
must
look
at
the
geography
of
egypt
egyptian
civilization
was
built
on
the
banks
of
the
nile
river
which
flooded
each
year
depositing
soil
on
its
banks
the
rich
soil
could
help
farmers
grow
enough
crops
to
feed
the
people
in
the
cities
that
meant
everyone
did
not
have
to
farm
so
some
people
could
perform
other
jobs
that
helped
develop
the
civilization
nowadays
we
can
enjoy
athletic
competition
of
every
kind
without
leaving
our
homes
it
is
the
fun
that
comes
from
cheering
on
our
team
and
celebrating
its
skills
while
complaining
about
the
opposing
team
good
luck
but
some
individuals
sit
and
watch
a
football
game
or
tennis
match
without
cheering
for
anyone
or
any
team
they
are
not
willing
to
risk
the
possible
disappointment
of
picking
the
loser
so
they
give
up
the
possible
joy
of
picking
the
winner
they
live
in
the
world
of
neutrality
don
be
one
of
them
sure
your
team
might
lose
but
then
again
your
team
might
win
either
way
your
spectator
experience
will
have

not

look
there
he
said
those
chokecherry
trees
are
small
and
weak
in
comparison
to
this
cottonwood
but
when
you
were
a
child
they
survived
a

without
losing
a

this
old
cottonwood
on
the
other
hand
lost
several
branches
it
stood
up
to
the

it
could
not
bend

the

the
chokecherry

could
the
specific
combinations
of
foods
in

and
the
ways
they
are

constitute
a
deep
reservoir
of
accumulated
wisdom
about
diet
and
health
and
place
in
latin
america
for
example
corn
is
traditionally
eaten
with
beans
each
plant
is
deficient
in
an
essential
amino
acid
that
happens
to
be
abundant
in
the
other
so
together
corn
and
beans
form
a
balanced
diet
in
the
absence
of
meat
similarly
corn
in
latin
america
is
traditionally
ground
or
soaked
with
limestone
which
makes
available
a
b
vitamin
in
the
corn
the
absence
of
which
would
otherwise
lead
to
a
deficiency
disease
very
often
when
a
society
adopts
a
new
food
without
the
food
culture
surrounding
it
as
happened
when
corn
first
came
to
europe
africa
and
asia
people
get
sick
the
context
in
which
a
food
is
eaten
can
be
nearly
as
important
as
the
food
itself
now
many
kinds
of
superior
coffee
beans
are
being
decaffeinated
in
ways
that
conserve
strong
flavor
but
the
public
suffers
from
a
groundless
fear
of
chemical
decaffeination
and
prefers
instead
to
buy
water
processed
decaf
a
the
solvent
comes
into
direct
contact
with
them
carrying
the
caffeine
with
it
the
drained
solvent
is
then
mixed
with
water
and
the
caffeine
is
drawn
out
to
be
sold
b
in
the
water
process
however
no
solvent
touches
the
beans
after
the
beans
are
steamed
they
are
soaked
in
water
which
removes
the
caffeine
along
with
all
the
soluble
solids
in
the
beans
the
solution
is
drained
off
to
a
separate
tank
where
the
caffeine
is
drawn
out
from
it
c
every
process
of
decaffeination
whether
chemical
or
water
based
starts
with
steaming
the
green
beans
to
loosen
the
bonds
of
caffeine
in
the
chemical
process
a
solvent
circulates
through
the
beans
processing
a
tv
message
is
much
more
like
the
all
at
once
processing
of
the
ear
than
the
linear
processing
of
the
eye
reading
a
printed
page
according
to
mcluhan
television
is
fundamentally
an
acoustic
medium
to
make
this
point
clear
he
invited
people
to
try
a
simple
experiment
first
turn
the
sound
down
on
the
tv
set
for
one
minute
during
your
favorite
program
now
for
another
minute
adjust
the
tv
set
so
that
you
can
hear
the
sound
but
you
can
see
any
picture
which
condition
was
more
frustrating
which
condition
gave
you
less
information
mcluhan
believed
that
people
who
tried
this
little
exercise
would
invariably
report
more
frustration
in
the
condition
where
the
picture
was
visible
but
the
sound
was
inaudible
most
people
have
a
vase
or
two
in
a
cupboard
but
lots
of
things
can
be
turned
into
stylish
containers
for
a
flower
arrangement
so
before
you
rush
out
to
buy
anything
look
around
your
own
home
for
instance
goldfish
bowls
look
stunning
filled
with
flower
heads

petals
magnifying
their

wine

of

in

shapes
and
sizes
lined
up
on

an

exist
in
the
form

older

estimation
asking
questions
such
as
how

do
you
think

as
a
result
they
can
learn
the
names
of

a
one
saturday
during
the
summer
i
asked
my
father
if
he
would
go
down
to
the
schoolyard
and
play
basketball
with
me
i
had
just
finished
the
fifth
grade
and
wanted
desperately
to
make
the
middle
school
team
the
coming
fall
a
i
couldn
believe
my
ears
when
he
called
for
my
mother
and
sister
to
come
along
for
in
the
traditional
fashion
my
mother
was
the
house
accountant
the
launderer
and
of
course
the
cook
b
she
turned
from
the
basket
and
began
heading
the
other
way
b
um
mah
i
cried
at
her
my
irritation
already
bubbling
over
the
basket
over
here
after
a
few
steps
she
turned
around
and
from
where
the
professional
three
point
line
must
be
now
she
effortlessly
flipped
the
ball
up
in
the
air
its
flight
truer
and
higher
than
i
witnessed
from
any
boy
or
man
the
ball
curved
cleanly
into
the
basket
stiffly
popping
the
chain
link
net
all
afternoon
she
rained
in
shot
after
shot
as
my
father
and
i
ran
after
her
c
when
we
got
home
from
the
playground
my
mother
showed
me
the
photograph
album
of
her
high
school
days
i
was
shocked
to
learn
that
she
had
been
the
top
player
for
the
national
high
school
team
that
once
won
the
all
asia
championships
c
for
years
i
kept
it
in
my
room
on
the
same
shelf
that
housed
the
scrapbooks
i
made
of
basketball
stars
with
magazine
clippings
of
great
players
such
as
bubbles
hawkins
pistol
pete
and
george
gervin
d
when
we
arrived
my
sister
immediately
ran
off
to
the
swings
and
d
i
recall
being
annoyed
that
my
mother
wasn
following
her
i
dribbled
awkwardly
around
the
free
throw
line
almost
losing
control
of
the
ball
and
made
a
flat
shot
that
bounced
wildly
off
the
basket
the
ball
fell
to
my
father
who
took
a
few
not
so
graceful
dribbles
and
missed
an
easy
layup

he
rebounded
his
shot

this
plays
an
essential
role
in

scientific
fields

in
industry
it
is
used
throughout
the
home
at
work
and
often
in
play
one
of
the
greatest
benefits
of
this
is
that
it
lets
in
light
and
provides
protection
from
the
weather
at
the
same
time
this
allows
daylight
in
but
keeps
out

keep
out

oxygen

the
first
TRUE
piece
of
sports
equipment
that
man
invented
was
the
ball
in
ancient
egypt
pitching
stones
was
children
favorite
game
but
a
badly
thrown
rock
could
hurt
a
child
egyptians
were
therefore
looking
for
something
less
dangerous
to
throw
and
they
developed
what
were
probably
the
first
balls
they
were
first
made
of
grass
or
leaves
held
together
by
strings
and
later
of
pieces
of
animal
skin
sewn
together
and
stuffed
with
feathers
or
hay
even
though
the
egyptians
were
warlike
they
found
time
for
peaceful
games
before
long
they
devised
a
number
of
ball
games
perhaps
they
played
ball
more
for
instruction
than
for
fun
ball
playing
was
thought
of
mainly
as
a
way
to
teach
young
men
the
speed
and
skill
they
would
need
for
war
it
is
my
great
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
your
sons
and
daughters
have
completed
all
the
academic
requirements
over
the
last
three
years
of
study
at
hutt
high
school
we
feel
as
if
the
day
they
entered
our
school
were
yesterday
and
now
they
will
proudly
receive
their
graduation
certificates
not
unlike
many
successful
graduates
in
our
long
history
your
children
will
go
out
into
the
world
and
successfully
participate
in
the
fields
of
politics
economics
culture
and
education
the
graduation
ceremony
will
be
held
next
friday
in
hutt
high
school
assembly
hall
on
behalf
of
the
school
i
would
like
to
extend
our
invitation
to
you
and
your
family
i
look
forward
to
meeting
you
there
the
first
thing
i
notice
upon
entering
this
garden
is
that
the
ankle
high
grass
is
greener
than
a
that
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
dozens
of
wildflowers
of
countless
varieties
cover
the
ground
to
b
both
either
sides
of
the
path
creeping
plants
cover
the
polished
silver
gate
and
the
sound
of
bubbling
water
comes
from
somewhere
the
perfume
of
wildflowers
c
fill
fills
the
air
as
the
grass
dances
upon
a
gentle
breeze
a
large
basket
of
herbs
rests
against
the
fence
to
the
west
every
time
i
walk
in
this
garden
i
think
now
i
know
what
it
is
like
to
live
in
paradise
in
general
one
memories
of
any
period
necessarily
weaken
as
one
moves
away
from
it
one
is
constantly
learning
new
facts
and
old
ones
have
to
drop
out
to
make
way
for
them
at
twenty
i
could
have
written
the
history
of
my
school
days
with
an
accuracy
which
would
be
quite
impossible
now
but
it
can
also
happen
that
one
memories
grow
much
sharper
even
after
a
long
passage
of
time
this
is
because
one
is
looking
at
the
past
with
fresh
eyes
and
can
isolate
and
as
it
were
notice
facts
which
previously
existed
undifferentiated
among
a
mass
of
others
there
are
things
what
in
a
sense
i
remembered
but
which
did
not
strike
me
as
strange
or
interesting
until
quite
recently
over
the
years
various
systems
of
grading
coins
have
been
developed
by
antique
coin
specialists
in
america
a
numerical
system
based
on
a
scale
of
to
has
been
introduced
in
which
is
the
lowest
grade
possible
and
is
perfect
the
european
grades
verbal
descriptions
correspond
roughly
to
every
ten
of
the
american
grades
coins
reflect
both
a
country
history
and
its
aspirations
and
it
is
natural
that
collections
based
on
place
of
origin
should
develop
thus
the
european
grade
good
corresponds
to
of
the
american
system
fine
to
very
fine
to
extremely
fine
to
and
almost
perfect
to
until
recently
numerical
grading
has
been
applied
only
to
american
coins
but
the
intention
is
that
eventually
these
numbers
will
be
used
for
all
types
of
coins
from
all
over
the
world
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
is
lying
in
front
of
you
and
you
have
to
fill
it
up
suddenly
your
mind
may
seem
as
blank
as
the
paper
what
can
you
do
to
set
your
pen
in
motion
the
answer
is
simple
don
be
caught
in
the
trap
that
is
if
you
can
convince
yourself
that
the
first
draft
isn
your
best
writing
and
can
be
made
more
effective
with
additional
thought
and
some
revision
then
it
will
be
easier
to
get
started
when
starting
don
worry
about
what
the
reader
will
think
about
what
you
have
written
make
writing
as
easy
for
you
as
you
can
by
not
being
concerned
with
how
good
the
first
draft
is
there
will
be
time
for
revising
and
polishing
any
ideas
you
want
to
pursue
later
when
people
began
to
bind
books
with
pages
that
could
be
turned
rather
than
unrolled
like
papyrus
the
process
of
changed
now
the
reader
could
easily
move
backward
in
the
text
to
find
a
previously
read
passage
or
browse
between
widely
separated
sections
of
the
same
work
with
one
technological
change
cross
referencing
became
possible
while
the
physical
space
needed
to
house
a
collection
of
books
was
sharply
reduced
page
numbers
became
a
possibility
as
did
indexes
tables
of
contents
became
workable
references
what
is
the
most
prevalent
and
perhaps
most
important
prefix
of
our
times
the
answer
should
be
multi
which
means
more
than
one 
our
modern
jobs
are
increasingly
requiring
multi
tasking
our
communities
are
getting
multi
cultural
our
entertainment
is
multi
media
while
detailed
knowledge
of
a
single
area
once
guaranteed
success
today
the
top
rewards
go
to
those
who
can
operate
with
equal
confidence
in
different
realms
let
us
call
these
people
boundary
crossers
they
develop
expertise
in
multiple
areas
they
speak
different
languages
and
they
they
live
multi
lives
because
that
is
more
interesting
and
nowadays
more
effective
night
diving
is
obviously
less
simple
than
diving
during
the
day
but
when
properly
organized
it
is
relatively
straightforward
a
powerful
flashlight
will
easily
light
your
way
and
the
creatures
around
you
revealing
marine
life
in
its
TRUE
colors
however
if
you
cover
up
your
flashlight
you
will
many
creatures
use
phosphorescence
at
night
and
as
you
move
through
the
water
you
will
cause
plankton
to
release
tiny
pulses
of
light
leaving
beautiful
glowing
wakes
trailing
behind
you
there
are
few
people
who
do
not
react
to
music
to
some
degree
the
power
of
music
is
diverse
and
people
respond
in
different
ways
to
some
it
is
mainly
an
a
instinctive
inactive
exciting
sound
to
which
they
dance
or
move
their
bodies
other
people
listen
for
its
message
or
take
an
intellectual
approach
to
its
form
and
construction
b
appreciating
confusing
its
formal
patterns
or
originality
above
all
however
there
can
be
hardly
anyone
who
is
not
moved
by
some
kind
of

music
c
covers
removes
the
whole
range
of
emotions
it
can
make
us
feel
happy
or
sad
helpless
or
energetic
and
some
music
is
capable
of
overtaking
the
mind
until
it
forgets
all

object
identification
rarely
occurs
in
isolation
face
perception
seems
to
work
the
same
way
notice
that
when
seen
as
part
of
a
face
presented
in
figure
a
any
bump
or
line
will
be
sufficient
to
depict
a
feature
however
the
result
may
be
different
when
the
features
are
separated
from
the
context
as
shown
in
figure
b
the
features
in
figure
b
are
basically
identical
with
those
in
figure
a
but
out
of
context
they
are
less
identifiable
as
in
figure
c
we
actually
require
a
more
simplified
presentation
than
in
figure
b
to
identify
facial
features
unambiguously
when
presented
in
isolation
thus
our
understanding
of
context
compensates
for
lack
of
detail
in
the

identification
process
a
boy
entered
a
coffee
shop
where
i
worked
as
a
waitress
he
sat
at
a
table
and
asked
me
how
much
an
ice
cream
sundae
was
fifty
cents
i
replied
the
little
boy
pulled
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
and
studied
a
number
of
coins
in
it
how
much
is
a
dish
of
plain
ice
cream
he
inquired
some
people
were
now
waiting
for
a
table
and
i
was
impatient
thirty
five
cents
i
said
angrily
the
little
boy
again
counted
the
coins
and
he
ordered
the
plain
ice
cream
i
brought
the
ice
cream
and
walked
away
the
boy
finished
paid
the
cashier
and
departed
when
i
came
back
i
swallowed
hard
at
what
i
saw
there
placed
neatly
beside
the
empty
dish
were
fifteen
pennies
my
tip
one
key
social
competence
is
how
well
or
poorly
people
express
their
own
feelings
paul
ekman
uses
the
term
display
rules
for
the
social
agreement
about
which
feelings
can
be
properly
shown
when
cultures
sometimes
vary
tremendously
in
this
regard
a
ekman
and
his
colleagues
in
an
asian
country
studied
the
facial
reactions
of
students
to
a
horrific
film
about
a
teenage
aboriginal
ritual
ceremony
when
the
students
watched
the
film
with
an
authority
figure
present
their
faces
showed
only
the
slightest
hints
of
reaction
b
when
they
thought
they
were
alone
though
they
were
being
taped
by
a
secret
camera
their
faces
twisted
into
vivid
mixes
of
uncomfortable
feelings
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
a
question
what
kind
of
world
will
our
children
have
to
live
in
will
they
have
air
to
breathe
and
food
to
eat
these
are
among
the
basic
questions
that
were
addressed
at
the
first
world
meeting
on
the
environment
attended
by
more
than
world
leaders
and
other
scientists
newspeople
and
citizens
concerned
these
complex
problems
can
no
longer
be
solved
by
individual
countries
nations
of
the
world
must
act
together
if
we
are
to
develop
answers
that
will
give
a
safe
and
healthy
world
to
our
children
world
leaders
should
have
the
vision
to
protect
our
environment
there
is
healing
power
in
flowers
and
in
trees
fresh
air
and
sweet
smelling
soil
just
walking
through
a
garden
or
for
that
matter
seeing
one
out
your
window
can
lower
blood
pressure
reduce
stress
and
ease
pain
get
out
there
and
start
digging
and
the
benefits
multiply
while
it
may
be
basic
and
even
old
fashioned
using
gardening
as
a
health
care
tool
is
blossoming
new
or
remodeled
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
increasingly
come
equipped
with
healing
gardens
where
patients
and
staff
can
get
away
from
barren
indoor
surroundings
many
also
offer
patients
a
chance
to
get
their
hands
dirty
and
their
minds
engaged
in
caring
for
plants
most
of
us
buy
our
food
from
supermarkets
in
fact
many
of
us
don
even
get
as
far
as
the
supermarket
but
make
our
choices
at
the
click
of
a
mouse
we
have
abandoned
our
relationship
with
the
food
we
eat
and
with
the
people
who
produce
our
food
is
it
any
wonder
that
our
children
don
know
where
food
comes
from
is
it
any
wonder
that
we
tired
overweight
irritable
and
low
it
is
important
to
be
mindful
about
every
single
aspect
of
purchasing
food
try
not
to
race
through
your
shopping
in
my
hometown
nobody
would
buy
a
melon
without
feeling
it
and
smelling
it
and
nobody
would
dream
of
buying
a
chicken
without
knowing
which
farm
it
came
from
and
what
it
ate

recreational
tree
climbing
is
an
evolving
sport
it
got
its
start
in
when
peter
jenkins
began
teaching
all
sorts
of
people
including
children
how
to
climb
trees
safely
using
a
rope
and
a
harness
and
the
recreational
tree
climbing
technique
in
the
united
states
it
is
now
practiced
by
a
thousand
or
so
people
but
is
rapidly
growing
in
popularity
however
those
who
study
rare
plants
are
worried
about
recreational
tree
climbers
they
fear
that
these
climbers
may
try
to
climb
the
biggest
and
tallest
trees
if
they
learn
their
exact
locations
any
contact
between
humans
and
rare
plants
can
be
disastrous
for
the
plants
a
status
symbol
is
something
usually
an
expensive
or
rare
object
that
indicates
a
high
social
status
for
its
owner
what
is
considered
a
status
symbol
will
differ
among
countries
based
on
the
states
of
their
economic
and
technological
development
and
common
status
symbols
will
change
over
time
status
symbols
can
indicate
the
cultural
values
of
a
society
let
take
some
examples
in
a
society
that
cherishes
honor
or
bravery
a
battle
wound
would
be
more
of
a
status
symbol
in
a
commercial
society
where
having
money
or
wealth
is
most
important
things
that
can
be
brought
by
wealth
such
as
cars
houses
or
fine
clothing
are
considered
status
symbols
and
in
a
society
where
people
craze
for
beauty
the
condition
of
one
skin
and
body
can
be
a
status
symbol
a
the
ability
to
sympathize
with
others
reflects
the
multiple
nature
of
the
human
being
his
potentialities
for
many
more
selves
and
kinds
of
experience
than
any
one
being
could
express
this
may
be
one
of
the
things
that
enable
us
to
seek
through
literature
an
enlargement
of
our
experience
although
we
may
see
some
characters
as
outside
ourselves
that
is
we
may
not
identify
with
them
completely
we
are
nevertheless
able
to
enter
into
their
behavior
and
their
emotions
thus
the
youth
may
identify
with
the
aged
one
gender
with
the
other
and
a
reader
of
a
particular
limited
social
background
with
members
of
a
different
class
or
a
different
period
however
when
you
try
to
tickle
yourself
you
are
in
complete
control
of
the
situation
newton
was
the
first
to
point
out
that
light
is
colorless
and
that
consequently
color
has
to
occur
inside
our
brains
he
wrote
the
waves
themselves
are
not
colored
since
his
time
we
have
learned
that
light
waves
are
characterized
by
different
frequencies
of
vibration
when
they
enter
the
eye
of
an
observer
they
set
off
a
chain
of
neurochemical
events
the
end
product
of
which
is
an
internal
mental
image
that
we
call
color
the
essential
point
here
is
what
we
perceive
as
color
is
not
made
up
of
color
although
an
apple
may
appear
red
its
atoms
are
not
themselves
red
if
we
want
to
describe
our
society
in
terms
of
age
we
may
come
up
with
four
age
groups
childhood
adolescence
maturity
and
old
age
we
take
it
for
granted
that
people
of
different
ages
behave
differently
for
example
we
feel
that
a
man
in
his
thirties
should
act
his
age
and
not
behave
like
an
adolescent
or
an
old
man
equally
we
expect
that
as
they
go
through
life
people
of
the
same
age
will
in
some
ways
understand
each
other
better
than
people
of
different
ages
all
this
is
part
of
expected
ways
of
behaving
in
our
social
life
but
it
is
not
something
that
we
can
apply
in
formal
institutions
governed
by
hard
and
fast
rules
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
told
to
enter
i
found
myself
in
a
large
room
where
the
curtains
were
closed
to
allow
no
daylight
in
and
the
candles
were
lit
in
the
center
of
the
room
sitting
at
a
table
was
the
strangest
lady
i
had
ever
seen
she
was
wearing
a
wedding
dress
made
of
rich
material
she
had
a
bride
flowers
in
her
hair
but
her
hair
was
white
she
only
had
one
white
shoe
on
then
i
realized
that
over
the
years
the
flowers
in
her
hair
had
died
and
the
bride
inside
the
dress
had
grown
old
everything
in
the
room
was
ancient
the
only
brightness
in
the
room
was
in
her
dark
old
eyes
that
stared
at
me
one
of
the
toughest
parts
of
isolation
is
a
lack
of
an
expressive
exit
with
anger
you
can
get
mad
at
someone
and
yell
with
sadness
you
can
cry
but
isolation
feels
like
being
in
a
room
with
no
way
out
a
for
people
who
cannot
push
themselves
however
support
groups
are
a
good
cure
for
isolation
they
offer
the
opportunity
for
connection
in
a
safe
and
controlled
way
b
and
the
longer
you
get
stuck
there
the
harder
it
becomes
to
share
the
pain
and
sorrow
in
isolation
hope
disappears
despair
rules
and
you
can
no
longer
see
a
life
beyond
the
invisible
walls
that
imprison
you
c
some
people
find
it
helpful
to
work
gently
at
driving
themselves
back
into
the
world
in
one
case
a
woman
reported
that
after
four
miserable
forced
lunches
with
friends
she
suddenly
enjoyed
the
fifth
one
as
she
found
herself
laughing
at
a
joke
with
the
rise
of
the
social
sciences
and
especially
the
anthropology
of
the
s
and
thereafter
words
like
savage
and
primitive
began
to
disappear
from
the
vocabulary
of
cultural
studies
along
with
the
notion
that
the
people
who
had
once
borne
these
labels
represented
a
biologically
less
evolved
form
of
humanity
medical
science
could
find
no
difference
in
the
brains
of
the
former
primitives
to
account
for
their
different
behavior
colonists
necessarily
observed
that
yesterday
savage
might
be
today
shopkeeper
soldier
or
servant
as
humanity
began
to
look
more
like
a
family
of
potential
equals
westerners
had
to
accept
that
the
behavior
found
in
native
cultures
was
not
the
distinctive
feature
of
savage
otherness
but
the
expression
of
a
capacity
that
may
exist
for
better
or
for
worse
in
all
of
us
westerners
came
to
admit
that
their
view
toward
the
a
behavior
found
in
native
cultures
was
b

is
a
good
reason

after

the

at

captain
koppe
looked
out
at
the
island
through
the
window
he
had
been
longing
for
c
it
since
his
childhood
at
that
moment
his
family
picture
posted
on
the
inside
of
the
aircar
came
into
his
eyes
all
of
a
sudden
he
had
an
irresistible
urge
to
go
to
see
his
beloved
wife
and
his
two
sons
he
turned
his
back
on
the
island
of
paradise
and
directed
d
it
toward
the
homeland
d
captain
koppe
sensed
that
this
was
one
of
those
times
when
he
had
to
be
alone
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
remind
himself
that
he
would
have
to
make
his
decision
alone
and
he
would
have
the
duration
of
the
flight
all
to
himself
the
thought
appealed
to
him
as
he
powered
up
the
aircar
and
e
it
lifted
a
half
meter

not
only
does
the
leaf
fish
look
like
a
leaf
but
it
also
imitates
the
movement
of
a
drifting
leaf
underwater
its
hunting
technique
is
not
to
swiftly
pursue
its
victim
but
to
wait
for
it
hanging
at
an
angle
in
the
water
the
leaf
fish
is
carried
along
by
the
currents
until
it
comes
near
a
smaller
fish
then
it
seizes
the
unsuspecting
prey
with
a
lightning
fast
snap
of
the
jaws
and
swallows
the
prey
down
head
first
at
close
range
the
rapid
opening
of
the

fish
large
jaws
enables
it
to
suck
in
the
unfortunate
individual
very
easily
when
one
group
borrows
something
such
as
ideas
values
foods
or
styles
of
architecture
from
another
group
change
occurs
through
diffusion
diffusion
is
a
process
by
which
one
culture
or
society
borrows
from
another
the
extent
and
rate
of
diffusion
depend
on
the
degree
of
social
contact
the
more
contact
a
group
has
with
another
group
the
more
likely
it
is
that
objects
or
ideas
will
be
exchanged
the
exclusion
of
new
technology
generally
leads
to
social
change
that
will
soon
follow
social
contact
therefore
plays
a
crucial
role
in
the
process
of
diffusion
thank
you
for
sending
your
poems
to
this
publishing
house
i
have
had
the
opportunity
to
look
them
over
and
i
feel
that
they
show
considerable
promise
despite
your
youth
and
lack
of
experience
in
this
genre
there
is
still
much
room
for
development
however
and
i
am
afraid
they
are
not
yet
appropriate
for
publishing
in
any
of
our
current
poetry
journals
you
indicate
in
your
cover
letter
that
you
intend
to
follow
a
literary
career
please
allow
me
to
offer
my
best
wishes
for
your
future
literary
efforts
i
was
five
years
old
when
my
father
introduced
me
to
motor
sports
dad
thought
a
it
which
was
a
normal
family
outing
to
go
to
a
car
racing
event
it
was
his
way
of
spending
some
quality
time
with
his
wife
and
kids
b
few
little
did
he
know
that
he
was
fueling
his
son
with
a
passion
that
would
last
for
a
lifetime
i
still
remember
the
awesome
feeling
i
had
on
that
day
in
may
when
my
little
feet
c
carried
were
carried
me
up
the
stairs
into
the
grandstands
at
the
car
racing
stadium
to
be
a
mathematician
you
don
need
an
expensive
laboratory
the
typical
equipment
of
a
mathematician
is
a
blackboard
and
chalk
it
is
better
to
do
mathematics
on
a
blackboard
than
on
a
piece
of
paper
because
chalk
is
easier
to
erase
and
mathematical
research
is
often
filled
with
mistakes
one
more
thing
you
need
to
do
is
to
join
a
club
devotes
to
mathematics
not
many
mathematicians
can
work
alone
they
need
to
talk
about
what
they
are
doing
if
you
want
to
be
a
mathematician
you
had
better
expose
your
new
ideas
to
the
criticism
of
others
it
is
so
easy
to
include
hidden
assumptions
that
you
do
not
see
but
that
are
obvious
to
others
walking
down
the
street
you
may
not
even
notice
the
trees
but
according
to
a
new
study
they
do
a
lot
more
than
give
shade
environmental
scientists
chose
two
chicago
public
housing
projects
both
of
which
had
some
buildings
with
lots
of
trees
nearby
and
some
with
practically
none
according
to
the
study
violence
and
property
crimes
were
nearly
twice
as
high
in
sections
of
the
buildings
where
vegetation
was
low
compared
with
the
sections
where
vegetation
was
high
why
one
explanation
greenery
creates
a
natural
gathering
space
for
neighbors
and
ultimately
stronger
in
the
community
this
can
also
create
an
atmosphere
where
children
are
better
supervised
and
buildings
better
watched
people
tend
to
stick
to
their
first
impressions
even
if
they
are
wrong
suppose
you
mention
the
name
of
your
new
neighbor
to
a
friend
oh
i
know
him
your
friend
replies
he
seems
nice
at
first
but
it
all
an
act
perhaps
this
evaluation
is
groundless
the
neighbor
may
have
changed
since
your
friend
knew
him
or
perhaps
your
friend
judgment
is
simply
unfair
whether
the
judgment
is
accurate
or
not
once
you
accept
it
it
will
probably
influence
the
way
you
respond
to
the
neighbor
even
if
this
neighbor
were
a
saint
you
would
be
likely
to
interpret
his
behavior
in
ways
that
a
common
mistake
in
talking
to
celebrities
is
to
assume
that
they
don
know
much
about
anything
else
except
their
occupations
in
fact
the
movie
business
and
the
athletic
world
are
full
of
intelligent
educated
and
informed
men
and
women
who
are
interested
and
involved
in
a
wide
variety
of
activities
and
causes
yet
they
are
asked
only
about
acting
or
sports
if
you
happen
to
know
about
the
celebrity
extracurricular
interest
you
might
find
he
or
she
will
speak
to
you
about
it
much
more
freely
than
about
his
or
her
for
example
ask
paul
newman
the
famous
actor
about
his
charity
work
with
kids
upon
entering
a
record
store
one
encounters
a
wide
variety
of
genres
from
easy
listening
to
jazz
and
classical
music
jazz
and
classical
music
have
a
number
of
things
in
common
however
they
also
have
a
number
of
differences
before
sound
recording
classical
music
was
passed
down
through
written
scores
whereas
early
jazz
mainly
relied
on
live
performance
the
composers
are
in
control
in
classical
music
they
write
the
musical
notes
along
with
detailed
instructions
in
jazz
on
the
contrary
the
performers
often
improvise
their
own
melodies
in
sum
classical
music
and
jazz
both
aim
to
provide
a
depth
of
expression
and
detail
but
they
our
guest
arrived
in
the
broadcasting
studio
and
i
opened
my
show
at
with
a
brief
introduction
about
his
background
then
i
asked
my
first
question
and
he
just
said
i
don
know
a
few
more
questions
followed
but
all
were
answered
in
one
of
three
ways
yes
no
or
i
don
know
i
looked
up
at
the
clock
in
the
studio
it
was
and
i
was
out
of
material
i
had
nothing
left
to
ask
this
guy
everyone
in
the
studio
was
standing
around
with
the
same
thought
what
are
we
going
to
do
we
have
fifty
minutes
left
listeners
all
over
the
country
are
going

reach

second
now
of
all
the
ways
that
automobiles
damage
the
urban
environment
and
lower
the
quality
of
life
in
big
cities
few
are
as
maddening
and
unnecessary
as
car
alarms
alarms
are
more
than
just
an
annoyance
they
are
a
costly
public
health
problem
and
a
constant
irritation
to
urban
civil
life
the
benefits
meanwhile
are
nonexistent
auto
makers
alarm
installers
insurers
police
and
the
biggest
experts

all
agree
that
alarms
do
nothing
to
stop
theft
what
more
there
are
now
a
number
of
good
inexpensive
car
security
devices
available
on
the
market
it
time
for
us
all
to
reconsider
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
and
to
do
something
about
it
although
most
people
recognize
it
as
a
jewel
the
diamond
most
directly
affects
our
daily
lives
as
a
tool
industrial
diamonds
are
so
important
that
a
a

would
cause
a
breakdown
in
the
metal
working
industry
and
would
destroy

production
industrial
diamonds
are
crushed
and
powdered
and
then
used
in
many
grinding
and
polishing
operations
their
use
b
changes
ranges
from
the
drill
in
a
dentist
office
to
saws
for
cutting
rocks
and
to

the
great

hardness
hardship
of
a

every
mother
and
father
wants
to
raise
a
child
with
a
strong
moral
character
we
want
our
children
to
know
good
from
bad
and
right
from
wrong
we
hope
they
learn
to
behave
morally
and
ethically
and
grow
up
to
be
honest
and
considerate
in
short
we
want
our
children
to
develop
a
conscience
a
powerful
inner
voice
that
will
keep
them
on
the
right
path
but
a
conscience
does
not
develop
by
itself
so
the
job
of
building
one
is
ours
it
a
process
parents
need
to
work
on
day
after
day
and
year
after
year
we
need
to
constantly
distinguish
right
from
wrong
and
to
model
appropriate
behavior
eventually
our
children
will
fully
accept
our
messages
and
they
will
become

footwear
has
a
history
which
goes
back
thousands
of
years
and
it
has
long
been
an
article
of
necessity
a
the
earliest
footwear
was
undoubtedly
born
of
the
necessity
to
provide
some
protection
when
moving
over
rough
ground
in
varying
weather
conditions
in
ancient
times
as
today
the
basic
type
of
shoes
worn
depended
on
the
climate
b
shoes
have
not
always
served
such
a
purely
functional
purpose
however
and
the
requirements
of
fashion
have
dictated
some
curious
designs
not
all
of
which
made
walking
easy
c
for
instance
in
warmer
areas
the
sandal
was
and
still
is
the
most
popular
form
of
footwear
whereas
the
modern
moccasin
derives
from
the
original
shoes
adopted
in
cold
climates
by
races
such
as
eskimos
and
siberians
the
story
starts
in
the
world
of
homer
where
the
stormy
skies
and
the
dark
seas
were
ruled
by
the
mythical
gods
every
advance
in
human
understanding
since
then
has
been
made
by
brave
individuals
daring
to
step
into
the
unknown
darkness
and
to
break
free
from
accepted
ways
of
thinking
most
of
those
steps
were
small
and
difficult
but
a
few
were
brilliant
and
beautiful
as
gustave
flaubert
wrote
among
those
who
go
to
sea
there
are
the
explorers
who
discover
new
worlds
adding

through
their
unceasing
trial
and
error
who
have
paved
the
way
for
us
to
follow
most
of
us
believe
that
we
can
trust
in
technology
to
solve
our
problems
whatever
problem
you
name
you
can
also
name
some
hoped
for
technological
solution
some
of
us
have
faith
that
we
shall
solve
our
dependence
on
fossil
fuels
by
developing
new
technologies
for
hydrogen
engines
wind
energy
or
solar
energy
some
of
us
have
faith
that
we
shall
solve
our
food
problems
with
genetically
modified
crops
newly
or
soon
to
be
developed
those
with
such
faith
assume
that
the
new
technologies
will
ultimately
succeed
without
harmful
side
effects
however
there
is
no
basis
for
believing
that
technology
will
not
cause
new
and
unanticipated
problems
while
solving
the
problems
that
it
previously
produced
after
the
snowstorm
came
thick
fog
and
in
that
fog
fredrick
men
soon
lost
their
way
on
an
ice
river
with
hundreds
of
big
holes
in
it
not
only
could
they
see
nothing
in
front
of
them
but
they
were
tired
and
ill
and
could
not
walk
any
more
so
they
had
to
stay
in
their
tents
near
the
mountains
for
four
days
after
that
time
fredrick
went
to
albert
marshall
tent
you
are
ill
albert
he
said
you
can
come
to
the
pole
take
two
men
and
go
back
tomorrow
next
day
fredrick
watched
regretfully
as
marshall
sled
disappeared
slowly
in
the
distance
from
there
they
were
taken
to
arizona
and
were
reassembled
by
workers
in
the
arizona
desert
in
the
early
s
london
bridge
was
in
trouble
cars
trucks
and
buses
were
too
heavy
for
it
and
the
bridge
was
sinking
into
the
thames
river
london
city
officials
wanted
to
build
a
new
bridge
and
a
businessman
named
robert
mcculloch
decided
to
buy
the
old
bridge
and
move
it
to
arizona
workers
disassembled
the
bridge
in
numbering
the
bricks
and
sent
them
to
los
angeles
the
bridge
was
finally
completed
in
however
mcculloch
knew
he
needed
more
than
a
famous
bridge
to
attract
people
to
lake
havasu
city
so
he
created
an
english
village
with
typical
english
shops
and
restaurants
today
london
bridge
is
one
of
arizona
biggest
attractions
people
who
run
sports
camps
think
of
the
children
first
they
do
their
best
to
create
enjoyable
and
protective
environments
in
which
the
children
feel
comfortable
and
safe
unfortunately
some
sports
coaches
in
the
camps
occasionally
become
over
enthusiastic
in
their
desire
to
help
the
children
excel
as
a
result
they
put
pressure
on
them
to
perform
at
high
levels
win
at
all
costs
and
keep
playing
even
when
they
get
hurt
this
no
pain
no
gain
approach
is
extremely
stressful
and
leads
to
unnecessary
injuries
parents
should
therefore
take
care
when
they
send
their
children
to
a
sports
camp
and
should
talk
with
the
sports
coaches
to
see
if
they
will
respect
the
children
wishes
in
choosing
the
most
a
sports
camp
for
their
children
parents
should
make
sure
that
the
coaches
have
b
attitudes
to
children
they
all
reached
the
beach
two
hours
later
exhausted
but
safe
at
that
time
the

thanked
margo
for
saving
his
life

a
he
asked
why
she
had
been
so
insistent
about
going
slowly
and
quietly
because
she
said
to
him
for
one
thing
i
knew
it

a
long
way

had
to

e
one
of

said
i
don

how

one
myth
tells
how
a
group
of
gods
had
a
meeting
to
decide
where
to
hide
the
truth
of
the
universe
from
people
the
first
god
suggested
putting
it
under
the
ocean
but
the
others
shouted
him
down
saying
that
people
would
build
an
underwater
boat
to
take
themselves
there
to
find
it
a
second
god
suggested
hiding
it
on
a
planet
far
from
the
earth
but
the
other
gods
realized
that
a
craft
might
be
built
to
reach
this
destination
as
well
finally
a
third
god
suggested
that
they
hang
it
around
the
neck
of
every
human
being
the
other
gods
agreed
that
people
would
never
look
at
it
for
the
truth
so
they
did
exactly
as
the
third
god
had
suggested
usually
filmmakers
shoot
more
film
than
is
needed
an
uncut
movie
might
last
four
or
five
hours
working
in
an
office
or
studio
these
people
cut
the
film
down
to
about
two
hours
selecting
and
assembling
scenes
they
cut
out
parts
that
don't
fit
in
well
sometimes
they
discover
parts
that
seem
to
drag
they
speed
up
the
action
by
shortening
or
cutting
slow
scenes
their
work
may
take
several
months
after
all
the
scenes
have
finally
been
joined
in
the
correct
order
the
film
is
ready
for
presentation
on
most
subway
trains
the
doors
open
automatically
at
each
station
but
when
you
are
on
the
mtro
the
subway
in
paris
things
are
different
i
watched
a
man
on
the
mtro
a
try
tried
to
get
off
the
train
and
fail
when
the
train
came
to
his
station
he
got
up
and
stood
patiently
in
front
of
the
door
waitingfor
it
b
opened
toopen
it
never
opened
the
train
simply
started
up
again
and
went
on
to
the
next
station
in
the
mtro
you
have
to
open
the
doors
yourself
by
pushing
a
button
depressing
a
lever
or
c
slide
sliding
them
i
wonder
how
many
people
give
up
just
when
success
is
almost
within
reach
they
endure
day
after
day
and
just
when
they 
about
to
make
it
decide
they
can't
take
any
more
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
is
not
that
great
successful
people
have
simply
learned
the
value
of
staying
in
the
game
until
it
is
won
those
who
never
make
it
are
the
ones
who
quit
too
soon
when
things
are
darkest
successful
people
refuse
to
give
up
because
they
know
they 
almost
there
things
often
seem
at
its
worst
just
before
they
get
better
the
mountain
is
steepest
at
the
summit
but
that 
no
reason
to
turn
back
you
can
certainly
make
bad
quality
wine
from
good
quality
grapes
but
you
cannot
make
good
quality
wine
from
bad
quality
grapes
what
happens
in
the
vineyard
is
crucial
to
start
with
you
need
well
drained
not
necessarily
over
fertile
soil
in
order
to
make
the
vine 
roots
dig
deep
into
the
soil
after
the
grapes
are
picked
either
by
hand
or
by
machine
they
are
taken
to
the
winery
the
vineyard
needs
plenty
of
exposure
to
the
sun
in
cool
climate
areas
there
needs
to
be
enough
rain
or
in
some
cases
irrigation
with
too
little
water
the
grape
skins
become
too
tough
and
they
fail
to
ripen
someone
who
reads
only
newspapers
and
books
by
contemporary
authors
looks
to
me
like
a
near
sighted
person
he
is
completely
dependent
on
the
prejudices
of
his
times
and
what
a
person
thinks
on
his
own
without
being
stimulated
by
the
thoughts
and
experiences
of
other
people
is
at
best
insignificant
and
monotonous
there
are
only
a
few
enlightened
people
with
a
clear
mind
and
with
good
taste
within
a
century
what
has
been
preserved
of
their
work
belongs
among
the
most
precious
possessions
of
mankind
we
owe
it
to
a
few
writers
of
old
times
that
the
people
in
the
middle
ages
could
slowly
free
themselves
from
ignorance
electricity
consumption
by
country
the
above
chart
shows
the
electricity
consumption
in
five
countries
in
and
of
the
five
countries
the
united
states
consumed
the
greatest
amount
of
electricity
in
both
and
china
and
japan
consumed
the
same
amount
of
electricity
in
but
four
years
later
china 
consumption
increased
by
more
than
billion
kilowatt
hours
while
japan 
remained
unchanged
the
increase
in
china 
electricity
consumption
was
the
second
largest
among
the
five
countries
india 
consumption
increased
to
slightly
over
billion
kilowatt
hours
in
but
brazil 
remained
below
billion
kilowatt
hours
the
united
states
remains
an
underdeveloped
country
when
it
comes
to
language
skills
immigrants
are
importing
their
mother
tongues
at
record
rates
yet
the
vast
majority
of
americans
remain
stubbornly
monolingual
ignorance
of
other
languages
and
cultures
handicaps
the
united
states
in
dealing
with
the
rest
of
the
world
today
the
language
policies
in
the
united
states
address
this
problem
primarily
with
efforts
to
teach
foreign
languages
to
monolingual
americans
meanwhile
the
united
states
seeks
to
eliminate
these
same
skills
among
ethnic
minorities
by
reducing
existing
bilingual
programs
out
of
misplaced
fears
of
or
haste
to
force
their
assimilation
instead
of
focusing
on
immigrants 
disabilities
in
english
why
not
encourage
them
to
maintain
their
abilities
in
their
mother
tongues
while
they
learn
english
the
introduction
of
unique
products
alone
does
not
guarantee
market
success
another
vital
factor
is
increasing
one 
responsiveness
to
the
markets
by
providing
products
suited
for
the
local
communities
that
make
up
the
market
this
means
understanding
that
each
country
community
and
individual
has
unique
characteristics
and
needs
it
requires
in
other
words
one
of
the
challenges
is
to
avoid
a
one
size
fits
all
strategy
that
places
too
much
emphasis
on
the
global
aspect
alone
even
categorizing
countries
as
developed
or
emerging
is
dangerous
upon
closer
analysis
emerging
countries
are
not
only
vastly
different
from
one
another
they
are
also
composed
of
numerous
unique
individuals
and
communities
learning
to
ski
is
one
of
the
most
humbling
experiences
an
adult
can
undergo
that
is
one
reason
to
start
young
after
all
an
adult
has
been
walking
for
a
long
time
he
knows
where
his
feet
are
he
knows
how
to
put
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
in
order
to
get
somewhere
but
as
soon
as
he
puts
skis
on
his
feet
it
looks
as
though
he
he
slips
and
slips
falls
down
has
trouble
getting
up
gets
his
skis
crossed
tumbles
again
and
generally
looks
and
feels
like
a
fool
the
most
common
mistake
made
by
amateur
photographers
is
that
they
are
not
physically
close
enough
to
their
subjects
this
means
that
the
center
of
interest
the
subject
is
just
a
spot
too
small
to
have
any
impact
even
when
it
is
big
enough
to
be
recognized
it
usually
carries
little
meaning
viewers
may
think
that
a
subject
is
small
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
when
you
look
at
other
photographers
work
pay
attention
to
how
they
fill
the
frame
everything
in
it
should
serve
the
message
of
the
image
if
you
see
things
through
your
camera
lens
that
distract
from
what
you
are
trying
to
say
so
when
you
photograph
people
remember
to
get
closer
to
them
to
exclude
unwanted
objects
darwin
was
the
first
to
propose
that
long
necks
evolved
in
giraffes
because
they
enabled
the
animals
to
eat
the
treetop
leaves
a
so
simmons
became
convinced
that
this
competition
for
mates
not
stretching
for
treetop
food
was
what
drove
the
evolution
of
the
neck
b
this
seemingly
reasonable
explanation
has
held
up
for
over
a
century
but
it
is
probably
wrong
says
robert
simmons
a
behavioral
ecologist
simmons
was
studying
eagles
in
africa
when
he
came
across
a
pair
of
male
giraffes
locked
in
combat
c
he
saw
the
male
giraffes
battling
for
mates
by
swinging
their
powerful
necks
which
were
over
six
feet
long
and
weighed
more
than
pounds
he
observed
that
in
contests
of
this
type
males
with
the
longest
thickest
necks
usually
won
if
you
connect
a
primitive
digital
camera
to
your
pc
and
aim
it
at
a
happy
face
your
computer
might
perceive
the
image
as
it
appears
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
given
drawing
the
digitized
image
of
the
face
is
rough
because
the
computer
thinks
in
terms
of
ones
and
zeros
and

this

in

enhance

the
shapes
of
korean
kites
are
based
on
scientific
a
particles
principles
which
enable
them
to
make
good
use
of
the
wind
one
particular
korean
kite
is
the
rectangular
shield
kite
which
has
a
unique
hole
at
its
center
this
hole
helps
the
kite
fly
fast
regardless
of
the
wind
speed
by
b
concentrating
contaminating
the
wind
on
days
when
the
wind
is
light
and
letting
it
pass
through
when
the
wind
is
blowing
hard
the
center
hole
also
allows
the
kite
to
respond
quickly
to
the
flyer
c
commands
comments
for
these
reasons
korean
kites
such
as
the
shield
kite
are
good

kite
fighting
one
summer
night
a
man
stood
on
a
low
hill
overlooking
a
wide
expanse
of
forest
and
field
by
the
full
moon
hanging
low
in
the
west
he
knew
that
it
was
near
the
hour
of
dawn
a
light
mist
lay
along
the
earth
partly
veiling
the
lower
features
of
the
landscape
but
above
it
the
taller
trees
showed
in
well
defined
masses
against
a
clear
sky
two
or
three
farmhouses
were
visible
through
the
mist
but
in
none
of
them
naturally
was
a
light
nowhere
indeed
was
any
sign
or
suggestion
of
life
except
the
barking
of
a
distant
dog
which
served
to
accentuate
the
solitary
scene
the
room
was
warm
and
clean
the
curtains
drawn
the
two
table
lamps
lit
hers
and
the
one
by
the
empty
chair
opposite
on
the
sideboard
behind
her
two
tall
glasses
soda
water
champagne
now
and
again
she
would
glance
up
at
the
clock
but
without
anxiety
merely
to
please
herself
with
the
thought
that
each
minute
gone
by
made
it
nearer
the
time
when
he
would
come
there
was
a
slow
smiling
air
about
her
when
the
clock
said
ten
minutes
to
five
she
began
to
listen
and
a
few
moments
later
punctually
as
always
she
heard
the
car
approach
and
stop
outside
the
car
door
closed
and
her
heart
beat
faster
as
the
footsteps
passed
the
window
disharmony
enters
our
relationships
when
we
try
to
impose
our
values
on
others
by
wanting
them
to
live
by
what
we
feel
is
right
fair
good
bad
and
so
on
if
they
do
not
accept
our
values
we
become
annoyed
and
angry
however
we
must
realize
that
no
one
is
obligated
to
change
just
to
meet
our
expectations
of
how
we
feel
they
should
act
people
may
disturb
or
anger
us
but
the
fact
that
not
everyone
objects
to
their
behavior
indicates
that
the
problem
is
probably
ours
we
need
to
see
things
as
they
are
not
as
we
would
like
them
to
be
so
the
leopard
began
to
attack
dogs
and
cattle
in
the
village
villagers
heard
a
deer
barking
in
the
distance
but
they
were
not
the
only
ones
to
hear
it
a
leopard
stretched
full
length
on
a
large
tree
branch
heard
it
too
the
leopard
raised
its
head
and
then
got
up
slowly
deer
were
its
natural
prey
but
there
weren't
many
left
in
this
area
after
several
attacks
the
villagers
no
longer
allowed
their
cattle
to
wander
far
and
at
night
they
were
securely
locked
into
their
barns
favorite
dogs
used
to
walking
around
the
village
at
night
were
now
called
indoors
before
sunset
most
helpful
to
the
calm
and
peaceful
atmosphere
that
the
two
year
old
child
needs
but
cannot
produce
for
himself
herself
is
the
presence
of
comforting
music
in
almost
any
form
mother 
singing
can
help
chanting
a
request
such
as
time
to
come
to
breakfast
may
be
more
effective
than
simply
saying
the
request
records
especially
nursery
rhymes
are
just
the
thing
for
those
periods
at
the
end
of
the
morning
or
afternoon
when
children
are
often
easily
irritated
some
children
especially
boys
like
to
have
their
own
music
players
and
may
play
these
for
very
long
periods
of
time
everyone
has
instincts
and
listening
to
your
inner
voice
is
always
a
good
idea
but
when
you 
making
a
decision
following
your
instincts
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
learning
how
to
use
your
instincts
as
a
guide
in
decision
making
requires
effort
after
all
no
one 
instincts
are
always
correct
so
how
do
you
know
when
to
follow
them
and
when
to
ignore
them
following
your
instincts
could
lead
you
to
make
impulsive
decisions
that
you
may
regret
later
the
key
is
to
learn
how
to
use
your
instincts
to
support
not
dictate
your
decisions
use
your
experience
to
analyze
the
situation
your
past
experience
gives
you
the
basis
for
judging
whether
your
instincts
can
be
trusted
when
you
clean
out
your
storage
room
don't
throw
out
any
junk
until
you
determine
its
potential
as
a
collectible
a
what
often
appears
to
be
a
piece
of
worthless
old
junk
may
very
well
be
quite
valuable
for
instance
people
often
sell
old
record
albums
bottles
and
books
for
pennies
only
to
see
them
resold
for
tens
or
hundreds
of
dollars
as
parts
of
larger
collections
rarer
cases
involve
people
selling
paintings
that
were
actually
painted
by
famous
painters
b
before
you
have
a
garage
sale
call
an
antique
dealer
to
help
you
separate
the
valuable
from
the
worthless
junk
the
breadfruit
is
a
round
or
oval
fruit
that
grows
on
the
tropical
islands
in
the
pacific
ocean
it
grows
on
a
tree
that
reaches
a
height
of
about
meters
and
bears
shiny
dark
green
leaves
which
are
over
centimeters
long
the
fruit
is
first
green
in
color
then
it
turns
brown
and
if
allowed
to
ripen
fully
becomes
yellow
usually
breadfruit
is
gathered
before
it
ripens
and
is
cooked
on
hot
stones
the
pulp
of
breadfruit
looks
and
feels
much
like
new
bread
when
mixed
with
coconut
milk
it
makes
a
delicious
and
nourishing
pudding
researchers
at
solar
impulse
in
lausanne
switzerland
are
developing
a
solar
powered
single
pilot
aircraft
that
they
hope
will
fly
around
the
globe
in
in
order
to
generate
enough
electricity
from
solar
electric
panels
on
the
tops
of
its
wings
the
craft
will
need
a
wingspan
of
meters
at
the
same
time
however
its
weight
cannot
exceed
kilograms
meeting
these
conditions
requires
pushing
the
limits
of
materials
and
design
and
making
highly
efficient
electrical
components
batteries
and
power
management
systems
the
new
craft 
basic
design
emerged
from
computer
models
built
with
help
from
the
swiss
federal
institute
of
technology
in
lausanne
a
test
model
is
scheduled
to
be
completed
in
followed
by
manufacture
in
and
the
first
test
flight
in
the
most
satisfying
and
expressive
drawing
is
done
with
the
active
engagement
of
the
entire
body
your
hand
is
connected
to
your
whole
arm
the
arm
to
the
torso
supported
by
your
feet
on
the
floor
to
awaken
the
active
engagement
of
your
whole
body
in
drawing
try
the
following
begin
by
drawing
small
circles
in
space
with
each
of
your
fingers
then
move
your
hands
in
circles
around
the
wrist
next
make
bigger
circles
with
your
forearms
and
finally
make
giant
swinging
arm
circles
now
you
see
how
your
entire
body
can
be
used
in
the
activity
of
drawing
the
old
sumerian
cuneiform
could
not
be
used
to
write
normal
prose
but
was
a
mere
telegraphic
shorthand
whose
vocabulary
was
restricted
to
names
numerals
and
units
of
measure
a
related
limitation
was
that
few
people
ever
learned
to
write
this
early
script
knowledge
of
writing
was
confined
to
professionals
who
worked
for
the
king
or
temple
on
the
contrary
greek
alphabetic
writing
was
a
vehicle
of
poetry
and
humor
to
be
read
in
private
homes
the
first
preserved
example
of
greek
alphabetic
writing
scratched
onto
an
athenian

is
a
line
of
poetry

of
all

environmental
psychologists
have
long
known
about
the
harmful
effects
of
unpredictable
high
volume
noise
in
laboratory
experiments
people
exposed
to
decibel
bursts
of
noise
experienced
a
decrease
in
their
ability
to
solve
problems
however
when
subjects
either
could
predict
when
the
bursts
of
noise
would
occur
or
had
the
ability
to
terminate
the
noise
with
a
panic
button
the
negative
effects
disappeared
we
are
not
always
fortunate
enough
to
enjoy
a
work
environment
free
of
noise
pollution
but
when
we
feel
we
are
in
charge
of
our
noisy
environments
we
may
no
longer
suffer
from
anxiety
and
poor
performance
an
eskimo
once
told
european
visitors
that
the
only
TRUE
wisdom
lives
far
from
mankind
out
in
the
great
loneliness
and
can
be
reached
only
through
suffering
the
great
loneliness
like
the
loneliness
a
caterpillar
endures
when
she
wraps
herself
in
a
silky
cocoon
and
begins
the
long
transformation
to
butterfly
it
seems
that
we
too
must
go
through
such
a
time
when
life
as
we
have
known
it
is
over
and
yet
we
don't
know
who
we
are
supposed
to
become
all
we
know
is
that
something
bigger
is
calling
us
to
change
and
though
we
must
make
the
journey
alone
and
even
if
suffering
is
our
only
companion
soon
enough
we
will
become
a
butterfly
soon
enough
we
will
taste
the
joy
of
being
alive
there
are
many
everyday
misunderstandings
which
are
classified
as
folk
understandings
and
not
just
plain
folk
hold
these
misconceptions
aristotle
developed
an
entire
theory
of
physics
that
physicists
today
find
odd
and
amusing
for
example
aristotle
thought
that
moving
objects
kept
moving
only
if
something
kept
pushing
them
today 
physicists
say
this
is
nonsense
a
moving
object
continues
to
move
unless
some
force
is
used
to
stop
it
yet
anyone
who
has
ever
pushed
a
heavy
box
along
a
street
knows
that
aristotle
was
right
if
you
don't
keep
on
pushing
the
movement
stops
aristotle 
theory
may
be
bad
physics
but
it
describes
reasonably
well
what
we
can
see
in
the
real
world
folk
understandings
such
as
aristotle 
explanation
about
moving
objects
often
sound
a
to
many
people
even
though
they
are

what
they
are

our

we

simply
ridiculous
also
aside

concern

the

will
cause
first

games
to
be

remindful
of

bjorn
borg
jimmy
connors

john
mcenroe
tennis
is
in
some
trouble
people
seem
to
be
losing
interest
in
the
game
one
major
reason
for
this
is
that
the
men 
professional
game
has
lost
some
of
its
appeal
the
pro
game
has
become
a
contest
of
d
strength
where
powerful
hitters
with
their
high
tech
rackets
dominate
at
wimbledon
for
example
britain 
greg
rusedski
hit
the
ball
at
mph
the
fastest
recorded
serve
for
the
tournament
as
a
result
of
e
this
speed
very
few
points
last
more
than
three
shots
serve

also
aside
from
modifying
the
current
game
there
is
some
concern
that
players
may
suffer
arm
and
ligament
injuries
as
they
swing
harder
trying
to
draw
more
speed
out
of
the
ball
in

the
game
has
b
little
action
top
male
players
play
for
an
average
of
only
four
minutes
per
hour
on
grass
according
to
recent
studies
the
hope
is
that
the
introduction
of
the
new
bigger
ball
will
cause
first
class
games
to
be
dominated
again
by
play
involving
c
skill
and
artistry
remindful
of
players
like
bjorn
borg
jimmy
connors
and
john
mcenroe
tennis
is
in
some
trouble
people
seem
to
be
losing
interest
in
the
game
one
major
reason
for
this
is
that
the
men 
professional
game
has
lost
some
of
its
appeal
the
pro
game
has
become
a
contest
of
d
strength
where
powerful
hitters
with
their
high
tech
rackets
dominate
at
wimbledon
for
example
britain 
greg
rusedski

the

as

this

everyone
would
like
to
assume
that
their
wonderful
creative
ideas
will
sell
themselves
but
as
galileo
edvard
munch
toni
morrison
sylvia
plath
and
millions
of
others
have
discovered
they
do
not
on
the
contrary
creative
ideas
are
usually
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust
thus
students
need
to
learn
how
to
persuade
other
people
of
the
value
of
their
ideas
this
selling
is
part
of
the
practical
aspect
of
creative
thinking
if
students
do
a
science
project
it
is
a
good
idea
for
them
to
present
it
and
demonstrate
why
it
makes
an
important
contribution
if
they
develop
a
plan
for
a
new
form
of
government
they
should
explain
why
it
is
better
than
the
existing
form
of
government
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
decisive
moment
occurred
when
people
in
advertising
and
journalism
discovered
that
if
they
framed
their
stories
and
appeals
with
fear
they
could
capture
our
attention
it
is
an
emotion
we
find
hard
to
resist
or
control
and
so
they
constantly
shifted
our
focus
to
new
possible
sources
of
anxiety
the
latest
health
scare
the
new
crime
wave
and
endless
hazards
in
the
environment
of
which
we
were
not
aware
with
the
increasing
sophistication
of
the
media
and
the
haunting
quality
of
the
imagery
they
have
been
able
to
give
us
the
feeling
that
we
are
fragile
creatures
in
an
environment
full
of
danger
even
though
we
live
in
a
world
infinitely
safer
and
more
predictable
than
anything
our
ancestors
knew
with
their
help
our
anxieties
have
only
increased
in
the
past
many
public
sector
recreation
providers
allowed
people
free
access
or
charged
for
permits
to
control
the
amount
or
season
for
different
recreational
activities
such
as
fishing
or
horse
riding
however
governments
and
other
public
agencies
are
finding
that
funding
to
maintain
sites
and
facilities
to
cope
with
increased
demand
on
the
landscape
is
becoming
difficult
to
maintain
opportunities
to
charge
visitors
for
appropriate
services
to
help
compensate
for
these
costs
are
being
considered
as
one
solution
this
is
a
sensitive
matter
as
free
access
for
all
people
to
the
outdoors
is
a
much
cherished
right
there
is
also
an
additional
dilemma
for
public
agencies
where
recreation
facilities
are
already
provided
from
public
money
and
it
could
be
argued
that
the
taxpayer
is
being
charged
twice
thus
care
is
needed
by
public
bodies
to
ensure
that
charges
are
only
made
for
services
that
are
clearly
additional
to
the
provision
of
free
access
how
to
use
public
facilities
for
outdoor
activities
public
recreation
services
to

or

zaynab
fawwaz
was
born
into
a
poor
family
in
south
lebanon
as
a
young
girl
she
went
to
alexandria
with
the
egyptian
family
for
whom
she
worked
her
mistress
was
intrigued
by
her
maid
native
intelligence
and
introduced
zaynab
to
her
literate
friend
fatima
she
in
turn
taught
her
reading
writing
and
arithmetic
zaynab
quickly
learned
what
her
teacher
had
to
offer
and
in
time
went
on
to
study
with
egyptian
scholars
eventually
she
became
very
active
in
women
issues
and
she
wrote
some
pioneering
poetry
and
essays
focused
on
women
rights
the
most
famous
of
her
essays
was
the

an
association
between
loud

music
and
reckless

but
how
might
music
ability
to
influence
driving
in
this
way
be
explained
one
possibility
is
that
drivers
adjust
to
temporal
regularities
in
music
and
that
their
speed
is
influenced
accordingly
in
other
words
just
as
faster
music
causes
people
to
eat
faster
so
it

compel
us
to
look
at

in
a

way
and
to
discover
their

at

no

how

the

is
hard
to
overlook
as
humans
we
do
eat
with
our

because
our
sense
of

is
more
highly
developed
than
the
other

the

so
highly

in

that

are

the
rust
belt
is
notorious
for
its
poor
air
quality
for
decades
coal
plants
steel
production
and
auto
emissions
have
pumped
particulates
like
sulfate
into
the
atmosphere
over
the
eastern
u
s
especially
before
air
quality
laws
began
appearing
in
the
s
particulate
pollution
was
behind
acid
rain
respiratory
disease
and
ozone
depletion
but
a
new
study
from
harvard
university
suggests
that
the
rust
belt
thick
particulate
fog
may
have
helped
slow
down
the
effects
of
climate
change
particularly
when
it
was
thickest
throughout
the
th
century
global
temperatures
have
gone
up
by
just
under
one
degree
celsius
but
in
the
u
s
eastern
and
central
states
haven
seen
the
same
rise
in
fact
temperatures
there
actually
decreased
over
the
same
period
the
reason
seems
to
be
particulate
pollution
instead
of
trapping
warm
air
in
the
atmosphere
like
carbon
dioxide
fine
particles
like
sulfate
reflect
the
sun
light
and
heat
they
may
even
group
with
watery
cloud
droplets
which
do
the
same
thing
the
effect
is
suppose
a
survivor
from
an
airplane
crash
with
severe
injuries
struggles
for
days
through
the
jungle
but
dies
just
before
reaching
a
village
it
is
tempting
to
think
if
only
he
had
managed
to
walk
to
the
village
he
would
have
been
rescued
but
suppose
you
must
try
to
console
the
victim
relatives
what
might
you
say
or
suppose
you
wish
to
defend
the
rescue
team
who
got
as
far
as
the
village
but
no
further
your
motivation
to
console
or
defend
may
influence
the
alternative
you
imagine
you
may
decide
to
emphasize
the
severity
of
the
victim
injuries
and
suggest
even
if
he
had
managed
to
walk
to
the
village
he
still
would
have
died
sometimes
thoughts
about
what
might
have
been
change
an
antecedent
event
the
victim
walked
to
the
village
but
leave
the
outcome
unchanged
he
still
died
even
if
conditionals
have
been
called
semifactual
because
they
combine
a
counterfactual
antecedent
and
a
factual
consequence
imagined
semifactual
alternatives
are
intriguing
because
unlike
other
thoughts
about
what
might
have
been
they
suggest
that
the
so
called
mozart
effect
listening
to
mozart
will
make
your
child
smarter
is
a
good
example
of
by
the
media
through
hype
not
warranted
by
the
research
it
all
started
when
researchers
reported
that
after
exposure
to
a
selection
of
mozart
music
college
students
showed
an
increase
in
spatial
reasoning
for
about
minutes
on
tasks
like
putting
together
pieces
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
note
first
that
the
research
was
done
on
college
students
not
infants
and
that
the
effect
was
very
brief
in
addition
no
one
been
able
to
replicate
the
research
the
increase
in
spatial
reasoning
it
turns
out
can
be
generated
by
any
auditory
stimulation
e
g
listening
to
a
short
story
or
other
types
of
music
that
keeps
people
alert
while
being
tested
however
none
of
this
has
stopped
eager
parents
spurred
on
by
fantastic
claims
from
unethical
companies
from
purchasing
mozart
cds
for
their
babies
the
bond
between
parents
and
children
exaggerated
a
genuine
scientific
innovation
being
discarded
a
scientific
finding
being
distorted
the
correlation
between
reasoning
and
music
being
rejected
the
convergence
of
music
and
physiology
made
possible
as
the
structures
of
our
world
and
the
conditions
of
certainty
have
yielded
to
an
avalanche
of
change
the
extent
of
our
longing
for
stable
definitive
leadership
the
fault
lies
not
with
leadership
but
rather
with
ourselves
and
our
expectations
in
the
old
days
leaders
were
supposed
to
make
sense
of
chaos
to
make
certainty
out
of
doubt
and
to
create
positive
action
plans
for
the
resolution
of
paradoxes
good
leaders
straightened
things
out
should
chaos
rear
its
ugly
head
the
leader
was
expected
to
restore
normality
immediately
but
chaos
is
now
considered
normal
paradoxes
cannot
be
resolved
and
certainty
is
possible
only
to
the
level
of
high
probability
leadership
that
attempts
to
deliver
in
terms
of
fixing
any
of
these
can
only
fail
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
happening
can
only
be
measured
by
our
will
to
establish
it
has
made
traditional
leadership
more
irreplaceable
can
create
viable
action
plans
for
restoring
normality
has
vastly
reduced
the
probability
of
resolving
paradoxes
has
been
exceeded
only
by
the
impossibility
of
finding
it
when
a
company
comes
out
with
a
new
product
its
competitors
typically
go
on
the
defensive
doing
whatever
they
can
to
a
the
odds
that
the
offering
will
eat
into
their
sales
responses
might
include
increasing
marketing
efforts
offering
discounts
to
channel
partners
and
even
lobbying
for
regulations
that
would
hinder
the
rival
expansion
in
many
cases
though
such
actions
are
misguided
although
the
conventional
wisdom
that
a
rival
launch
will
hurt
profits
is
often
correct
my
research
shows
that
companies
sometimes
see
profits
increase
after
a
rival
launch
the
underlying
mechanism
is
pretty
simple
when
a
company
comes
out
with
a
new
product
it
often
raises
the
prices
of
its
existing
products
this
might
be
designed
to
make
the
new
product
look
b
and
thus
more
attractive
by
comparison
as
that
company
adjusts
its
pricing
its
competitors
can
do
the
same
without
risking
customer
defections
over
price
all
human
societies
have
economic
systems
within
which
goods
and
services
are
produced
distributed
and
consumed
in
one
sense
the
economic
aspect
of
culture
is
simply
the
sum
of
the
choices
people
make
regarding
these
areas
of
their
lives
these
choices
critically
determine
much
of
people
lives
a
choosing
to
become
a
farmer
rather
than
an
insurance
broker
may
determine
where
you
live
who
you
are
likely
to
meet
the
sorts
of
behaviors
you
will
expect
in
your
spouse
and
offspring
and
so
on
however
such
choices
are
not
unlimited
rather
they
are
limited
by
our
cultures
traditions
and
technologies
b
our
environments
set
the
boundaries
within
which
choices
about
the
production
distribution
and
consumption
of
goods
and
services
are
made
to
the
extent
that
economic
systems
are
part
of
culture
people
in
different
cultures
have
different
sorts
of
economic
behavior
organic
farmers
grow
crops
that
are
no
less
plagued
by
pests
than
those
of
conventional
farmers
insects
generally
do
not
discriminate
between
organic
and
conventional
as
well
as
we
do
td
a
however
most
organic
farmers
have
no
choice
but
to
rely
on
chemicals
as
necessary
supplements
to
their
operations
with
pests
often
consuming
up
to
percent
of
the
crops
grown
in
the
united
states
they
do
so
as
a
matter
of
course
b
they
might
refer
to
these
substances
as
botanical
extracts
but
according
to
ned
groth
a
senior
scientist
at
consumers
union
these
toxins
are
not
necessarily
less
worrisome
because
they
are
natural
c
it
is
TRUE
that
they
are
far
more
likely
than
conventional
farmers
to
practice
environmentally
beneficial
forms
of
biological
control
and
that
they
are
also
more
likely
to
sensibly
diversify
their
crops
to
reduce
infestation
but
the
ones
in
which
he
could
get
up
and
do
things
like
industrial
arts
drama
science
projects
or
p
e
were
always
his
favorites
jason
always
seemed
to
have
a
tough
time
in
classes
except
in
the
ones
where
he
could
do
something
in
the
classes
in
which
the
teachers
just
stood
and
talked
or
told
everyone
to
read
he
seemed
to
get
bored
and
restless
he
soon
realized
that
he
was
not
a
slow
or
unmotivated
learner
he
was
a
kinesthetic
learner
once
he
figured
this
out
he
started
to
use
this
information
to
his
advantage
he
would
draw
out
what
he
learned
from
class
on
notes
posters
and
doodles
he
would
act
out
things
and
work
with
other
students
on
projects
using
role
play
and
drama
this
helped
his
learning
come
alive
and
he
was
less
bored
as
a
result
he
not
only
enjoyed
school
more
but
his
grades
also
went
up
a
narrative
is
not
a
myth
the
first
time
it
is
told
but
only
a
story
or
an
account
what
makes
a
story
a
myth
is
the
fact
that
it
is
received
by
a
given
society
and
that
a
given
society
participates
in
its
transmission
obviously
it
is
difficult
to
determine
just
when
any
story
becomes
a
myth
but
it
is
clear
that
a
narrative
is
not
a
myth
when
it
is
first
told
the
intentions
of
the
first
narrator
and
the
last
narrator
can
be
the
same
but
this
still
does
not
give
any
special
status
to
the
creator
of
a
myth
it
is
far
more
important
to
realize
that
the
intentions
of
a
given
society
in
transmitting
a
narrative
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
purposes
of
its
author
thus
we
can
never
identify
any
individual
creator
of
a
myth
so
long
as
myth
is
a
collective
narrative
by
definition
the
only
relevant
consideration
are
the
mentality
and
purposes
of
the
society
for
which
the
myth
is
a
myth
given
the
a
nature
of
a
myth
a
narrative
becomes
a
myth

when
a
given
society
accepts
and

whatever

he

so
i
was
different
when
people
expect
to
see
someone
again
they
are
more
likely
to
find
that
person
attractive
regardless
of
the
individual
behavior
than
if
they
do
not
have
expectations
of

interaction
the
expectation
of
future
interaction
motivates
people
to
look
for
positive
qualities
in
someone
so
that
they
will
look
forward
to
future
interactions
rather
than
dread
them
and
increases
the
chances
that
people
will
find
the
individual
attractive
conversely
when
people
interact
with
someone
whom
they
do
not
foresee
meeting
again
they
have
little
reason
to
search
for
positive
qualities
in
fact
doing
so
may
be
depressing
given
that
they
may
not
have
the
opportunity
to
get
to
know
the
person
better
in
future
interactions
indeed
people
are
sometimes
motivated
to
find
negative
qualities
in
individuals
whom
they
do
not
expect
to
see
again
even
when
scientists
are
able
to
identify
seemingly
beneficial
nutrients
they
cannot
always
understand
how
those
nutrients
will
operate
in
a
real
life
context
in
the
course
of
our
daily
meals
fruits
and

believed
to
help
prevent

scientists
have
believed
that
it
is
the
antioxidants
in
these
foods
that
make
the
difference
compounds
like
beta
carotene
lycopene
and
vitamin
e
yet
when
these
molecules
were
extracted
from
fruits
and
vegetables
and
made
into
supplements
they
did
not
reduce
cancer
the
beta
carotene
supplement
actually
increased
the
risk
of
certain
cancers
in
other
words
scientists
thoroughly
misunderstood
the
causes
of
complex
events
they
identified
one
element
engaged
in
the
process
of

without
fully

how
the

as

truly

nutritional
scientists
pursuing
the
hot
paradigm
of
isolating
nutrients
failed
to
see
a
multitude
of
links
in
the
complex
chain
that
leads
to
good
health
problems
of

nutritional
supplements
out
of

artists
create
artistic
works
to
get
viewers
to
have
certain
kinds
of
experiences
but
the
intention
to
convey
certain
experiences
to
viewers
is
sometimes
secondary
to
the
intention
to
express
the
artistic
imagination
creatively
consider
actions
generally
for
the
moment
think
for
example
of
people
watching
their
favorite
sporting
team
whether
it
is
at
an
actual
match
or
in
a
bar
at
crucial
periods
in
a
game
people
tend
to
make
gestures
in
anticipation
or
cheer
in
exhortation
they
often
want
to
convey
their
sense
of
urgency
to
the
team
or
people
at
the
bar
may
want
to
show
their
disgust
to
others
in
the
crowd
but
they
often
express
themselves
in
this
manner
without
any
thought
for
what
others
think
or
how
they
may
respond
actions
we
perform
through
which
we
intend
to
express
our
feelings
thoughts
and
attitudes
need
not
have
any
communicative
intent
for
how
others
may
respond
at
least
some
works
should
be
understood
as
the
representation
of
just
this
kind
of
action
artistic
act
to
express
rather
than
to
communicate
artistic
masterpieces
products
of
viewers
desires
i
was
reminded
of
our
mission
earlier
this
year
when
my
mother
sold
her
house
because
of
my
father
failing
health
my
parents
recently
moved
from
florida
to
maryland
to
live
with
my
elder
sister
and
her
family
at
my
mom
request
my
brothers
sisters
and
i
sorted
through
all
her
belongings
she
told
us
to
keep
or
discard
whatever
we
pleased
for
myself
i
kept
a
solitary
piece
of
china
one
of
the
few
remaining
plates
from
the
set
my
grandfather
bought
my
mother
for
her
wedding
i
can
still
remember
the
set
in
better
days
serving
many
a
guest
on
a
sunday
afternoon
but
its
comrades
have
all
been
broken
or
have
disappeared
and
this
plate
is
all
i
have
it
is
delicate
and
faded
you
can
no
longer
read
the
pattern
name
printed
on
the
back
but
it
hangs
in
my
dining
room
as
a
pleasant
reminder
of
her
hospitality
it
had
long
been
something
of
a
mystery
where
and
on
what
the
northern
fur
seals
of
the
eastern
pacific
feed
during
the
winter
a
when
which
they
spend
off
the
coast
of
north
america
from
california
to
alaska
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
are
feeding
to
any
great
extent
on
sardines
mackerel
or
other
commercially
important
fishes
presumably
four
million
seals
could
not
compete
with
commercial
fishermen
for
the
same
species
without
the
fact
b
being
is
known
but
there
is
some
evidence
on
the
diet
of
the
fur
seals
and
it
is
highly
significant
their
stomachs
have
yielded
the
bones
of
a
species
of
fish
that
has
never
been
seen
alive
indeed
not
even
its
remains
c
has
have
been
found
anywhere
except
in
the
stomachs
of
seals
ichthyologists
say
that
this
seal
fish
belongs
to
a
group
that
typically
inhabits
very
deep
water
off
the
edge
of
the
continental
shelf
occasionally
there
are
children
who
have
trouble
understanding
that
their
clothing
choice
is
inappropriate
or
even
unhealthy
some
children
follow
the
suggestion
that
sandals
may
not
be
the
best
option
for
a
snowy
day
for
those
kids
experience
may
be
the
best
teacher
for
example
when
lydia
was
eight
years
old

nuttall
was
a
brilliant
archival
researcher

archaeologist
who
very
early
carved
a
career
for
herself
by
pursuing
independent
research
and
publishing
in
scholarly
journals
before

she
became
a
member
of
several
highly
prestigious
scientific
societies
on
the

of
her
work
she
was
the
winner
of
three

for
the

of
the

of
her
archival
work
and
archaeological
research
which
she
presented
in

and
the

nuttall
was
never
a
part
of
university
teaching
faculty
and
indeed
there
is
no
indication
that
she
would
have
accepted
such
a
position
had
it
been
offered
early
in

she
was

long

it

many

particularly
in

has
had
a

both
on
local
communities
and
on
native
plants
and
wildlife
where
wood
is
harvested
and
then
transported
halfway
across
the
globe
the
associated
energy
costs
are
high
causing
a
negative
impact
on
the
environment
what
is
more
where
wood
is
treated
with
chemicals
to

fire
and
pest
resistance
its
healthful
properties
are
compromised

that

be

feel
more
like

there
plenty
of
research
that
shows
that
people
who
work
with
the

create
all
kinds
of

for
themselves
it
the
people
who

to
the

when
confronted

a
seemingly
simple

task
where
their

are
put
in
conflict
with
outcomes
chimpanzees
find
it
impossible
to
exhibit
subtle
selfserving
cognitive
strategies
in
the
immediate
presence
of
a
desired
reward
however
such
tasks
are
mastered
in
one
study
chimps
were
confronted
by
a
simple
choice
two
plates
holding
tasty
food
items
were
presented
each
with
a
different
number
of
treats
if
the
chimp
pointed
to
the
plate
having
more
treats
it
would
immediately
be
given
to
a
fellow
chimp
in
an
adjacent
cage
and
the
frustrated
subject
would
receive
the
smaller
amount
after
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
trials
these
chimps
could
not
learn
to
withhold
pointing
to
the
larger
reward
however
these
same
chimps
had
already
been
taught
the
symbolic
concept
of
simple
numbers
when
those
numbers
were
placed
on
the
plates
as
a
substitute
for
the
actual
rewards
the
chimps
promptly
learned
to
point
to
the
smaller
numbers
first
thereby
obtaining
the
larger
rewards
for
themselves
as
immediate
rewards
replace
delayed
ones
when
an
alternative
symbol
system
is
employed
if
their
desires
for
the
larger
rewards
are
satisfied
when
material
rewards
alternate
with
symbolic
ones
if
the
value
of
the
number
is
proportional
to
the
amount
of
the
reward
after
making
a
choice
the
decision
ultimately
changes
our
estimated
pleasure
enhancing
the
expected
pleasure
from
the
selected
option
and
decreasing
the
expected
pleasure
from
the
rejected
option
if
we
were
not
inclined
to
a
the
value
of
our
options
rapidly
so
that
they
concur
with
our
choices
we
would
likely
second
guess
ourselves
to
the
point
of
insanity
we
would
ask
ourselves
again
and
again
whether
we
should
have
chosen
greece
over
thailand
the
toaster
over
the
coffee
maker
and
jenny
over
michele
consistently
second
guessing
ourselves
would
interfere
with
our
daily
functioning
and
promote
a
negative
effect
we
would
feel
anxious
and
confused
regretful
and
sad
have
we
done
the
right
thing
should
we
change
our
mind
these
thoughts
would
result
in
a
permanent
halt
we
would
find
ourselves
literally
stuck
overcome
by
b
and
unable
to
move
forward
on
the
other
hand
reevaluating
our
alternatives
after
making
a
decision
increases
our
commitment
to
the
action
taken
and
keeps
us
moving
forward
traditionally
we
have
assessed
mathematics
ability
based
on
the
number
of
correct
answers
on
a
page
full
of
computational
problems
learning
and
memorizing
facts
therefore
was
the
key
component
to
the
mathematics
instructional
program
recently
a
many
teachers
have
started
placing
a
greater
emphasis
on
mathematical
understanding
problem
solving
hands
on
experiences
and
collaborative
work
this
change
in
the
instructional
program
can
be
attributed
to
well
informed
teachers
and
the
work
of
the
national
council
of
teachers
of
mathematics
now
teachers
should
realize
that
their
students
will
be
using
mathematics
in
a
world
where
calculators
computers
and
other
forms
of
technology
are
readily
available
therefore
the
application
of
mathematics
rather
than
mere
fact
acquisition
is
what
will
be
expected
of
them
in
the
workplace
and
in
life
and
b
mathematics
instruction
should
mirror
this
real
life
application
most
of
the
words
we
use
and
the
meanings
we
think
about
are
a
combination
of
simpler
ideas
a
some
of
them
are
specialized
for
sitting
at
certain
high
places
like
bar
stools
if
you
learned
about
a
culture
in
which
a
certain
type
of
chair
was
used
only
for
the
purpose
of
sitting
while
waiting
for
a
bus
you
might
think
this
is
odd
but
would
have
no
difficulty
understanding
it
b
consider
a
chair
before
you
can
have
an
idea
of
a
chair
you
need
to
understand
that
there
exist
in
the
world
certain
functional
objects
some
of
these
objects
support
human
activity
in
this
case
sitting
c
the
combination
of
the
concepts
chair
and
waiting
for
bus
allows
you
to
create
the
new
complex
concept
chair
used
while
waiting
for
bus
but
the
basic
concept
of
chair
is
built
out
of
the
simpler
ideas
that
we
take
for
granted
object
furniture
sitting
by
changing
the
focus
or
context
of
a
task
we
can
get
renewed
energy
even
when
we
feel
that
we
are
completely
out
of
energy
to
demonstrate
this
a
psychologist
asked
people
to
take
part
in
what
she
called
semi
free
tasks
the
tasks
included
drawing
repeatedly
writing
ababababababab 
or
reading
a
short
poem
the
participants
were
asked
to
do
these
tasks
until
they
felt
exhausted
those
drawing
were
asked
to
redraw
their
last
picture
to
demonstrate
how
quickly
they
could
draw
those
writing
abab
were
asked
to
sign
their
name
and
address
in
this
new
context
their
fatigue
disappeared
this
phenomenon
of
creating
a
second
wind
can
be
seen
in
action
at
airports
where
security
officers
rotate
around
different
stations
to
stop
routine
induced
fatigue
from
settling
in
during
the
s
researchers
began
to
suggest
that
human
vulnerability
to
hazards
rather
than
the
hazards
themselves
was
central
to
understanding
the
importance
of
hazards
particularly
when
considering
that
a
city
is
a
geographical
focus
for
large
populations
further
it
was
reported
that
human
and
material
losses
from
disasters
had
increased
during
the
th
century
this
happened
at
a
time
when
cities
in
the
developing
world
were
growing
at
unprecedented
rates
bringing
together
large
populations
of
low
income
urban
residents
often
on
hazardous
spontaneous
settlements
which
made
them
far
more
vulnerable
to
natural
and
human
induced
hazards
it
is
precisely
this
issue
of
vulnerability
on
which
a
number
of
social
scientists
focused
arguing
that
although
floods
landslides
and
earthquakes
are
natural
processes
the
disasters
that
can
be
associated
with
them
are
not
a
result
of
natural
processes
but
of
human
vulnerability
with
the
dramatic
growth
of
a
in
developing
countries
environmental
hazards
could
turn
into
disasters
for
those
who
are
unable
to
b
their
impacts

of

please
take
good
care
of
yourself
a
king
once
boarded
a
galley
ship
as
he
passed
the
crew
of
slaves
he
asked
several
of
them
what
their
offenses
were
almost
every
man
claimed
he
was
innocent
they
laid
the
blame
on
someone
else
one
young
fellow
however
spoke
out
sire
i
deserve
to
be
here
i
stole
some
money
no
one
is
at
fault
but
myself
i
guilty
upon
hearing
this
the
king
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
and
shouted
you
scoundrel
what
are
you
doing
here
with
all
these
honest
men
get
out
of
their
company
at
once
he
was
then
set
free
the
key
to
this
prisoner
freedom
was
the
admission
of
his
guilt
remember
what
it
was
like
to
report
on
a
daily
deadline
for
the
first
time
or
to
interview
a
city
official
for
the
first
time
or
to
begin
to
maneuver
a
desktop
publishing
program
we
know
that
the
journalism
program
at
our
college
was
a
source
of
a
many
much
of
these
firsts
for
you
we
still
providing
these
important
first
experiences
to
budding
young
writers
and
editors
and
we
hoping
you
be
willing
to
help
these
students
make
it
through
the
program
as
you
know
the
costs
of
providing
first
rate
education
just
keep
going
up
we
done
everything
we
can
b
contain
to
contain
costs
without
compromising
quality
one
of
those
things
is
to
set
up
a
scholarship
fund
for
students
with
special
financial
needs
we
hope
you
would
consider
contributing
generously
to
our
fund
you
get
a
great
feeling
c
known
knowing
you
helping
support
the
formation
of
future
leaders
in
the
profession
a
today
the
world
of
innovation
is
far
different
from
what
it
was
a
century
ago
the
days
of
the
solitary
inventor
working
on
his
own
are
gone
to
oversimplify
basic
ideas
bubble
out
of
universities
and
laboratories
in
which
a
group
of
researchers
work
together
both
major
breakthroughs
like
understanding
the
genetic
structure
of
life
and
smaller
ones
such
as
advances
in
mathematics
or
basic
chemistry
traditionally
intellectual
property
has
played
little
role
in
promoting
basic
science
academia
believes
in
open
architecture
meaning
that
the
knowledge
that
research
produces
should
be
made
public
to
encourage
innovation
the
great
scientists
are
driven
by
an
inner
quest
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
universe
the
extrinsic
reward
that
matters
most
to
them
are
the
recognition
of
their
peers
we
often
dismiss
new
ideas
that
could
further
our
growth
simply
because
they
do
not
fit
within
the
general
framework
of
our
preconceived
notions
and
self
concepts
an
enormous
amount
of
time
is
spent
simply
reacting
it
as
if
we
are
robots
programmed
to
respond
on
cue
to
whatever
demands
the
least
time
and
attention
and
disregard
anything
that
requires
putting
in
extra
time
and
energy
to
think
we
skim
over
the
surface
thoughtlessly
but
we
must
acknowledge
that
thinking
well
is
a
time
consuming
process
we
can
expect
instant
results
we
have
to
slow
down
a
bit
and
take
the
time
to
contemplate
and
meditate
it
is
the
only
path
to
a
more
meaningful
and
efficient
existence
masks
are
too
heavy
to
uphold
indefinitely
and
no
matter
how
well
you
believe
you
are
disguising
yourself
others
always
know
the
consequences
are
that
you
waste
energy
sacrifice
productivity
and
lose
people
trust
in
our
study
all
of
the
ceos
were
concerned
that
dropping
their
masks
would
make
them
appear
weak
in
every
case
however
the
leader
subordinates
perceived
the
removal
of
the
mask
as
an
act
of
strength
and
courage
this
in
turn
encouraged
a
culture
where
those
subordinates
did
the
same
creating
a
snowball
effect
some
of
the
ways
we
helped
the
ceos
remove
their
masks
were
to
actually
name
the
masks
explore
the
significant
personal
and
professional
costs
of
upholding
them
and
ask
the
ceos
to
reflect
on
the
leader
they
most
admired
at
this
point
each
of
the
ceos
was
ready
to
rebuild
a
leadership
identity
based
on
values
strengths
and
ambitions
when
we
behave
irrationally
our
behavior
usually
seems
reasonable
to
us
when
challenged
the
mind
says
to
itself
why
are
these
people
giving
me
a
hard
time
i
just
doing
what
makes
sense
any
reasonable
person
would
see
that
in
short
we
naturally
think
that
our
thinking
is
fully
justified
as
far
as
we
can
tell
we
are
only
doing
what
is
right
and
proper
and
reasonable
any
fleeting
thoughts
suggesting
that
we
might
be
at
fault
typically
are
by
more
powerful
self
justifying
thoughts
i
don
mean
any
harm
i
just
i
fair
it
the
others
who
are
wrong
it
is
important
to
recognize
this
nature
of
the
human
mind
as
its
natural
state
in
other
words
humans
don
have
to
learn
self
justifying
self
serving
self
deceptive
thinking
and
behavior
these
patterns
are
innate
in
every
one
of
us
at
some
point
these
days
a
parent
realizes
his
or
her
child
is
tending
left
the
parent
panics
will
the
child
be
made
fun
of
struggle
with
writing
be
left
out
in
the
past
the
parent
would
have
done
everything
possible
to
exorcise
the
tendency
today
more
and
more
parents
shrug
their
shoulders
saying
it
okay
maybe
even
something
special
or
their
attempts
to
discourage
it
are
milder
this
is
not
an
isolated
reaction
it
part
of
the
larger
trend
toward
from
giving
children
extra
time
to
develop
into
kindergarteners
to
accommodating
their
vegetarian
appetites
parents
today
are
taking
their
cues
from
children
rather
than
the
other
way
around
left
handedness
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
in
today
world
parenting
is
about
letting
your
child
develop
into
his
or
her
own
person
not
about
trying
to
stamp
him
or
her
into
a
mold
of
conformity
it
is
a
common
misconception
among
many
musicians
and
non
musicians
alike
that
this
is
not
surprising
as
it
is
natural
to
associate
music
with
the
sounds
that
create
the
melody
rather
than
with
the
quiet
spaces
between
the
notes
because
rests
are
silent
people
often
misinterpret
these
empty
spaces
as
unimportant
but
imagine
what
would
happen
if
a
song
was
made
up
of
only
notes
and
no
rests
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
rests
would
be
history
pun
intended
there
would
be
a
wall
of
sound
with
no
reference
point
or
discernible
backbone
to
the
music
this
is
because
the
spaces
between
the
sounds
provide
a
baseline
and
contrast
for
the
piece
and
give
music
structure
and
texture
in
fact
it
is
a
common
saying
among
experienced
musicians
that
a
full
measure
of
rest
can
hold
more
music
than
a
full
measure
of
blistering
notes
notes
are
more
important
than
rests
rests
provide
a
direct
reference
point
to
music
silence
is
no
less
meaningful
than
sound
in
music
melody
is
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
sounds
structure
and
texture
are
the
most
crucial
aspects
of
music
cost
estimates
follow
from
time
estimates
simply
by
multiplying
the
hours
required
by
the
required
labor
rates
beware
of
for
example
one
major
company
has
a
policy
that
requires
the
following
personnel
in
order
to
remove
an
electric
motor
a
tinsmith
to
remove
the
cover
an
electrician
to
disconnect
the
electrical
supply
a
millwright
to
unbolt
the
mounts
and
one
or
more
laborers
to
remove
the
motor
from
its
mount
that
situation
is
fraught
with
inefficiency
and
high
labor
costs
since
all
four
trades
must
be
scheduled
together
with
at
least
three
people
watching
while
the
fourth
is
at
work
the
cost
will
be
at
least
four
times
what
it
could
be
and
is
often
greater
if
one
of
the
trades
does
not
show
up
on
time
inefficiency
caused
by
poor
working
conditions
difficulty
in
financing
high
labor
costs
in
business
differences
in
labor
skills
when
working
in
groups
coordination
problems
where
multiple
crafts
are
involved
mismatch
between
personnel
and
equipment
in
production
guys
lost
on
unfamiliar
streets
often
avoid
asking
for
directions
from
locals
we
try
to
tough
it
out
with
map
and
compass
admitting
being
lost
feels
like
admitting
stupidity
this
is
a
stereotype
but
it
has
a
large
grain
of
truth
it
also
a
good
metaphor
for
a
big
overlooked
problem
in
the
human
sciences
we
trying
to
find
our
way
around
the
dark
continent
of
human
nature
we
scientists
are
being
paid
to
be
the
bus
driving
tour
guides
for
the
rest
of
humanity
they
expect
us
to
know
our
way
around
the
human
mind
but
we
don
so
we
try
to
fake
it
without
asking
the
locals
for
directions
we
try
to
find
our
way
from
first
principles
of
geography
theory
and
from
maps
of
our
own
making
empirical
research
the
roadside
is
crowded
with
locals
and
their
brains
are
crowded
with
local
knowledge
but
we
are
too
arrogant
and
embarrassed
to
ask
the
way
so
we
drive
around
in
circles
about
where
to
find
the
scenic
vistas
that
would
entertain
and
enlighten
the
tourists
waiting
for
the
local
brains
to
inquire

and
examining

against
the

one
day
as
he
walked
through
the
streets
of
london
thomas
hobbes
the
seventeenth
century
philosopher
came
upon
an
old
sickly
man
who
was
begging
for
money
hobbes
his
heart
touched
immediately
gave
the
man
a
generous
offering
when
asked
by
a
friend
if
he
would
have
done
the
same
had
there
been
no
religious
dictum
or
philosophical
principle
about
helping
the
needy
hobbes
replied
that
he
would
his
explanation
he
felt
some
a
himself
when
he
saw
the
man
misery
and
so
just
as
giving
money
to
the
man
would
relieve
some
of
the
man
suffering
it
does
also
ease
me
this
tale
suggests
that
we
have
a
bit
of
self
interest
in
relieving
the
misery
of
others
one
school
of
modern
economic
theory
following
hobbes
argues
that
people
give
to
charities
in
part
because
of
the
b
they
get
from
imagining
either
the
relief
of
those
they
benefit
or
their
own
relief
from
alleviating
their
sympathetic
distress
while
there
are
aesthetic
and
ethical
reasons
for
preserving
biodiversity
there
are
practical
considerations
as
well
we
depend
on
many

madagascar

madagascar
has
lost

dilemma
represents
that
of
much
of
the
developing
world
the
island
is
home
to
over
million
people
most
of
whom
are
desperately
poor
and
hardly
in
a
position
to
be
concerned
with
environmental
conservation
b
the
people
of
madagascar
as
well
as
others
around
the
globe
could
derive
vital
benefits
from
the

that
is

over

forty
years
no
country
on
earth
has
cut
its
alcohol
consumption
more
than
france
while
consumption
of
beer
and
spirits
has
stayed
basically
steady
in
france
the
per
capita
consumption
of
alcohol
from
wine
fell
from
liters
in
to
about
in
one
reason
for
the
dwindling
wine
consumption
is
the
acceleration
of
the
french
meal
in
the
average
french
meal
lasted
minutes
plenty
of
time
for
half
a
bottle
if
not
a
whole
bottle
today
the
average
french
meal
has
been
slashed
down
to
minutes
wine
is
a
victim
of
the
disappearance
of
the
leisurely
meal
it
is
not
the
target
of
the
change
but
the
decline
in
wine
consumption
is
a
cause
of
the
emergence
of
the
faster
more
modern
on
the
go
lifestyle
one
of
the
most
commonly
cited
reasons
for
keeping
a
pet
animal
is
for
the
companionship
it
can
provide
the
general
term
companionship
usually
translates
into
partaking
in
shared
activities
such
as
walking
the
dog
playing
with
the
cat
however
such
behavioral
interactions
between
humans
and
pet
animals
are
usually
asymmetrically
organized
humans
tend
to
interact
with
their
pets
when
they
feel
like
it
rather
than
a
consistently
occasionally
responding
to
the
animal
demands
for
attention
in
addition
it
is
often
observed
that
once
interaction
between
humans
and
pets
has
arisen
the
termination
of
such
interactional
sequences
invariably
b
originates
separates
from
the
human
this
suggests
that
activities
like
walking
the
dog
and
playing
with
the
cat
only
arise
when
time
can
be
spared
from
the
human
owner
other
commitments
therefore
if
one
views
activity
as
a
global
concept
involving
instigation
performance
and
termination
labeling
certain
forms
of
human
pet
interaction
as
shared
activities
may
be
c
appealing
misleading
we
sometimes
encounter
students
who
come
to
our
offices
and
ask
how
they
could
have
worked
so
hard
but
still
failed
our
tests
they
usually
tell
us
that
they
read
and
reread
the
textbook
and
their
class
notes
and
that
they
thought
they
understood
everything
well
by
the
time
of
the
exam
and
they
probably
did
internalize
some
bits
and
pieces
of
the
material
but
the
illusion
of
knowledge
led
them
to
confuse
the
familiarity
they
had
gained
from
repeated
exposure
to
the
concepts
in
the
course
with
an
actual
understanding
of
them
as
a
rule
reading
text
over
and
over
again
yields
diminishing
returns
in
actual
knowledge
but
it
increases
familiarity
and
fosters
a
FALSE
sense
of
understanding
only
by
testing
ourselves
can
we
actually
determine
whether
or
not
we
really
understand
that
is
one
reason
why
teachers
give
tests
and
why
the
best

hundreds

social

fish
schools
vary
in
size
from
a
few
individuals
to
enormous
populations
extending
over
several
square
kilometers
schools
usually
consist
of
a
single
species
with
all
members
similar
in
size
or
age
for
small
animals
with
no
other
means
of

defense
schooling
behavior
provides
a
degree
of
protection
predatory
fishes
have
less
chance
of
encountering
prey
if
the
prey
are
members
of
a
school
because
the
individuals
of
the
prey
species
are
concentrated
in
compact
units
rather
than
dispersed
over
a
much
larger
area
moreover
once
a
predator
encounters
a
school
satiation
of
the
predator
enables
most
members
of
the
school
to
escape
unharmed
large
numbers
of
fishes
in
a
school
may
achieve
additional
survival
advantages
by
confusing
predators
with
continually
shifting

restoration
assumes
that
one
can
recreate
an
artist
original
intent
and
product
at
best
restorers
and
museum
directors
aesthetic
preferences
and
historical
theories
drive
restorations
for
it
is
impossible
to
step
outside
one
historical
context
how
can
restorers
be
so
sure
that
removing
a
layer
of
lacquer
isn
merely
their
subconscious
attempt
to
refashion
an
artwork
according
to
contemporary
tastes
what
restorative
about
that
the
restored
sistine
chapel
may
look
authentic
today
but
will
it
still
look
so
when
aesthetic
and
historical
theories
have
changed
surely
the
best
approach
with
any
great
work
of
art
is
to
simply
leave
it
alone
your
culture
maintains
an
implicit
schedule
for
the
right
time
to
do
many
important
things
for
example
the
right
time
to
start
dating
to
finish
college
to
buy
your
own
home
or
to
have
a
child
this
unspoken
timetable
provides
you
with
a
social
clock
a
schedule
that
tells
you
if
you
keeping
pace
with
your
peers
are
ahead
of
them
or
are
falling
behind
on
the
basis
of
this
social
clock
you
evaluate
your
own
social
and
professional
development
if
you
keep
up
with
the
rest
of
your
peers
then
you
feel
well
adjusted
competent
and
a
part
of
the
group
if
you
late
you
probably
experience
feelings
of
dissatisfaction
although
in
some
cultures
the
social
clock
is
becoming
more
flexible
and
more
tolerant
of
deviations
from
the
conventional
timetable
it
still
exerts
pressure
to
keep
pace
with
your
peers
economic
distance
relates
to
the
time
and
cost
involved
in
traveling
from
the
origin
to
the
destination
area
and
back
the
higher
the
economic
distance
the
higher
the
resistance
for
that
destination
and
consequently
the
lower
the
demand
it
follows
conversely
that
between
any
origin
and
destination
point
if
the
travel
time
or
travel
cost
can
be
reduced
demand
will
increase
many
excellent
examples
of
this
are
available
such
as
the
introduction
of
the
jet
plane
in
and
the
introduction
of
the
wide
bodied
jets
in
the
late
s
jet
planes
first
cut
travel
time
between
california
and
hawaii
for
example
from
twelve
hours
to
five
hours
and
demand
grew
dramatically
a
similar
surge
in
demand
was
experienced
with
the
introduction
of
the
wide
bodied
planes
for
transatlantic
flights
the
agricultural
products
picked
up
from
hawaiian
farms
in
the
morning
were
on
dinner
tables
in
californian
homes
by
evening
the
introduction
of
these
planes
cut
the
travel
cost
by
almost
percent
between
the
united
states
and
most
countries
on
the
european
continent
a
former
resident
of
canton
ohio
was
trying
to
describe
her
image
of
the
city
to
her
classmates
she
found
they
had
no
image
of
this
mid
sized
city
she
described
canton
as
a
city
with
major
manufacturing
facilities
and
a
downtown
revitalization
program
a
that
fact
suddenly
crystallized
the
concept
of
canton
if
canton
is
destroyed
the
nation
might
fall
that
an
image
that
gave
meaning
and
fullness
to
what
it
meant
to
live
in
canton
b
her
explanation
moved
the
city
from
the
position
of
no
image
to
that
of
a
negative
image
the
class
concluded
that
canton
is
a
typical
boring
industrialized
city
c
then
she
suddenly
recalled
an
experience
i
remember
hearing
from
a
teacher
that
during
world
war
ii
canton
was
a
major
u
s
target
of
the
germans
imagine
right
after
the
cities
of
chicago
new
york
and
los
angeles
appears
the
name
of
canton
studying
history
is
not
about
memorizing
what
we
have
been
told
it
requires
us
to
investigate
the
past
like
a
detective
we
start
with
the
easy
known
pieces
of
information
a
you
have
to
go
further
to
ask
questions
such
as
why
was
he
cruel
and
what
were
the
results
of
his
rule
hence
studying
history
trains
us
not
to
accept
everything
we
read
or
hear
as
the
truth
instead
it
trains
us
to
use
our
critical
thinking
skills
to
get
the
full
picture
of
the
past
b
for
example
if
someone
told
you
that
chinese
emperor
qin
shihuang
was
a
cruel
ruler
would
you
simply
accept
this
as
the
truth
or
would
you
ask
questions
about
the
statement
and
look
for
information
or
evidence
to
support
it
c
we
then
shuffle
the
pieces
around
to
see
how
they
fit
together
once
all
the
pieces
fit
we
have
the
full
picture
as
we
put
the
pieces
together
we
challenge
ourselves
to
think
of
other
ways
to
describe
what
we
know
when
you
hear
the
word
science
what
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
it
probably
an
image
of
a
laboratory
filled
with
glassware
and
sophisticated
equipment
the
person
doing
the
science
is
wearing
a
white
lab
coat
and
probably
looks
rather
serious
while
engaged
in
some
type
of
experiment
science
can
also
be
found
at
a
construction
site
on
a
basketball
court
and
at
a
concert
the
truth
is
that
science
is
happening
all
around
us
it
at
work
in
the
kitchen
when
cooking
meals
and
we
can
even
use
it
when
painting
pictures
architects
use
science
when
designing
buildings
and
science
also
explains
why
your
favorite
baseball
player
can
hit
a
home
run
many
of
us
believe
that
amnesia
or
sudden
memory
loss
results
in
the
inability
to
recall
one
name
and
identity
this
belief
may
reflect
the
way
amnesia
is
usually
portrayed
in
movies
television
and
literature
for
example
when
we
meet
matt
damon
character
in
the
movie
the
bourne
identity
we
learn
that
he
has
no
memory
for
who
he
is
why
he
has
the
skills
he
does
or
where
he
is
from
he
spends
much
of
the
movie
trying
to
answer
these
questions
however
the
inability
to
remember
your
name
and
identity
is
exceedingly
rare
in
reality
amnesia
most
often
results
from
a
brain
injury
that
leaves
the
victim
unable
to
form
new
memories
but
with
most
memories
of
the
past
intact
our
romantic
mistakes
can
always
be
undone
these
days
which
you
would
think
is
a
good
thing
but
the
very
reversibility
of
our
romantic
commitments
has
only
worsened
our
problem
because
that
also
undermines
our
satisfaction
with
our
choices
to
see
this
you
only
need
to
look
at
a
study
of
a
group
of
college
students
in
a
photography
class
the
students
made
a
print
of
their
two
best
photographs
they
were
then
told
that
they
could
choose
one
of
the
photos
but
that
the
other
would
be
kept
on
file
as
an
example
of
their
work
then
the
teacher
added
a
twist
one
group
was
told
that
their
choice
was
final
whatever
they
chose
they
could
not
change
their
minds
later
the
other
group
was
told
that
they
could
switch
photographs
if
they
changed
their
minds
in
a
survey
taken
later
students
who
were
allowed
to
change
their
mind
liked
their
photos
less
than
the
other
students
why
this
paradoxical
result
according
to
one
researcher
the
brain
has
a
kind
of
built
in
defense
system
that
works
to
make
us
choices
that
cannot
be
undone
despite
thinking
that
we
would
like
the
freedom
to
change
our
minds
it
appears
that
we
are
happier
with
our
choices
if
we
think
they
can
be
changed
which
means
we
would
be
better
off
if
we
made
romantic
commitments
more
permanent
and
more
difficult
to
break
rather
than
less
freedom
of
choice
everyone
unfulfilled
dream
when
do
we
need
permanent
relationships
most
happier
when
we
are
free
to
change
our
minds
why
do

their
romantic

have
always
been
a
huge
fan
of
redbug
cameras
however
when
i
purchased
your

the

i
could
not
have
been
more
disappointed
i
acquired
it
on
june

of
this

and
it
does
not
function
correctly
the
camera
lens
does
not
focus
properly
and
the
resulting
photos
are
blurry
and
unclear
i
went
to
the
local
service
center
to
get
it
repaired
but
the
poor
service
i
received
there
only
complicated
the
problem
i
am
extremely
frustrated
with
the
poor
quality
repairs
that
were
made
in

to
the
overall
inferior
quality

deseada
is
a
small
island
which
belongs
to
the
lesser
antilles
this
island
is
said
to
have
obtained
its
name
from
the
desire
christopher
columbus
felt
of
seeing
land
on
his
second
voyage
in
it
is
twelve
miles
in
length
and
six
miles
in
width
the
part
which
looks
to
the
north
is
lower
than
a
it
that
which
looks
to
the
south
the
island
abounds
greatly
in
iguanas
and
in
a
species
of
birds
called
fragatas
there
is
a
deep
cavern
on
the
island
containing
the
bones
and
arms
of
the
indians
who
it
is
supposed
b
was

who
where
restored
it
the
following

to
the
french
by
the
peace
of

since
that
time
it
has
been
in
the
possession
of
the
latter
if
you
ever
gone
snorkeling
you
may
have
seen
an
amazing
sight
an
entire
school
of
fish
suddenly
changes
direction
as
one
unit
the
same
goes
for
flocks
of
birds
so
are
they
all
following
the
commands
of
a
leader
researchers
have
determined
that
there
is
no
leader
or
controlling
force
rather
the
individual
fish
or
bird
is
reacting
almost
instantly
to
the
movements
of
its
neighbors
in
the
school
or
flock
any
individual
can
initiate
a
movement
such
as
a
change
in
direction
and
this
sends
out
a
maneuver
wave
which
spreads
through
the
group
at
an
astounding
speed
because
individuals
can
see
or
sense
the
wave
coming
toward
them
they
are
ready
to
react
more
quickly
than
they
would
without
such
advance
notice
that
appears
to
us
as
simultaneous
is
actually
a
kind
of
follow
your
neighbor
behavior
moving
faster
than
the
eye
can
see
to
require
perfection
is
to
invite
paralysis
the
pattern
is
predictable
as
you
see
error
in
what
you
have
done
you
steer
your
work
toward
what
you
imagine
you
can
do
perfectly
you
cling
ever
more
tightly
to
what
you
already
know
you
can
do
away
from
risk
and
exploration
and
possibly
further
from
the
work
of
your
heart
you
find
reasons
to
delay
since
to
not
work
is
to
not
make
mistakes
believing
that
your
work
should
be
perfect
you
gradually
become
convinced
that
you
cannot
do
it
you
are
correct
sooner
or
later
since
you
cannot
do
what
you
are
trying
to
do
you
quit
and
in
one
of
those
little
ironies
of
life
only
the
pattern
itself
achieves
perfection
a
perfect
death
spiral
you
misdirect
your
work
you
stall
you
quit
a
man
standing
on
the
street
corner
selling
nonbreakable
pens
suddenly
finds
that
the
one
he
is
demonstrating
with
breaks
in
half
he
stops
for
a
moment
turns
to
the
crowd
and
declares
now
i
show
you
what
the
inside
looks
like
laughter
can
turn
any
disadvantage
into
an
advantage
people
who
know
this
not
only
look
for
some
positive
aspect
in
their
misfortunes
but
actually
go
one
step
further
after
their
initial
shock
they
gather
their
resources
overcome
their
problem
and
see
opportunities
where
most
of
us
fail
to
see
them
moreover
many
who
have
experienced
a
major
loss
often
go
on
to
achieve
remarkable
feats
in
spite
of
their
hardships
because
they
focus
on
what
they
can
gain
from
their
circumstance
rather
than
on
what
they
have
lost
they
believe
in
the
old
clich
that
every
cloud
has
a
silver
lining
and
they
actively
seek
the
advantage
in
their
disadvantage
the
sun
is
slowly
getting
brighter

its
core
contracts
and

oxygen
will
be
left
in
the
stratosphere
perhaps
misleading
aliens
into
thinking
the
planet
is
still
inhabited
while
the
hydrogen
is
light
enough
to
escape
into
space
so
our
water
will
gradually
imagine
a
child
playing
on
the
beach
below
a
cliff
he
finds
a
cave
and
full
of
excitement
goes
in
suddenly
fear
seizes
him
in
the
deep
dark
of
the
cave
he
cannot
see
the
way
ahead
what
is
frightening
him
is
the
sense
of
the
unknown
stretching
into
the
black
distance
worries
can
be
like
this
our
anxiety
is
not
about
something
specific
but
more
of
a
sense
that
unknown
and
uncertain
possibilities
may
be
out
of
sight
far
ahead
we
can
stop
these
worries
from
growing
a
powerful
torch
or
flashlight
could
have
shown
the
child
the
limits
of
the
cave
we
can
by
asking
what
is
the
worst
that
can
happen
more
often
than
not
the
worst
that
we
fear
is
much
less
terrible
than
our
vague
unarticulated
fear
once
we
know
the
worst
we
can
face
it
directly
and
work
out
more
sensibly
what
to
do
people
have
found
many
ways
to
reduce
stress
or
control
their
responses
to
it
possibilities
include
special
breathing
routines
exercise
meditation
and
distraction
as
well
as
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
caused
the
stress
social
support
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
methods
of
coping
with
stress
and
researchers
have
demonstrated
its
effectiveness
by
brain
measurements
as
well
as
people
self
reports
in
one
study
happily
married
women
were
given
moderately
painful
shocks
to
their
ankles
on
various
trials
they
held
the
hand
of
their
husband
a
man
they
did
not
know
or
no
one
holding
the
husband
hand
reduced
the
response
in
several
brain
areas
holding
the
hand
of
an
unknown
man
reduced
the
response
a
little
on
the
average
but
not
as
much
as
holding
the
husband
hand
in
short
as
expected
brain
responses
correspond
to
people
self
reports
that
holding
hands
makes
them
feel
friendlier
exercise
and
meditation
lessen
ankle
pain
stimulating
the
brain
induces
happier
feelings
what
matters
the
most
is
how
to
measure
stress
social
support
from
a
loved
one
helps
reduce
stress
lifeline
infrastructures
are
vital
systems
that
support
a
nation
economy
and
quality
of
life
modern
economies
rely
on
the
ability
to
move
goods
people
and
information
safely
and
reliably
adding
to
their
importance
is
that
many
of
the
lifeline
systems
serve
vital
roles
in
disaster
recovery
consequently
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
government
business
and
the
public
at
large
that
the
flow
of
services
provided
by
a
nation
infrastructure
continues
unimpeded
in
the
face
of
a
broad
range
of
natural
and
technological
hazards
the
linkage
between
systems
and
services
is
critical
to
any
discussion
of
infrastructure
although
it
is
the
performance
of
the
hardware
i
e
the
highways
pipes
and
transmission
lines
that
is
of
immediate
concern
following
an
earthquake
it
is
actually
the
loss
of
services
that
these
systems
provide
that
is
the
real
loss
to
the
public
therefore
a
high
priority
in
protecting
these
systems
from
hazards
is
ensuring
an
early
alarm
system
for
economic
crises
the
durability
and
stability
of
transmission
lines
the
continuity
or
at
least
the
rapid
restoration
of

prompt
mobilization
of

for

the

and

of

systems
essentially
the
same
structural
forms
of
politics
can
nevertheless
take
on
very
different
flavors
for
example
a
dictatorship
can
in
theory
be
brutal
or
benevolent
anarchy
can
in
theory
consist
of
mutual
aid
or
a
war
of
all
against
all
that
proceeds
in
the
absence
of
any
rule
of
law
whatsoever
democracies
can
and
typically
are
distinguished
in
terms
of
the
extent
to
which
they
are
socially
oriented
as
opposed
to
individualistically
oriented
thus
whatever
our
answer
to
the
what
is
the
best
structural
form
of
politics
question
we
still
want
to
know
what
flavor
this
structural
form
of
politics
ought
to
have
since
indeed
this
is
precisely
why
we
vote
within
a
democratic
structure
to
determine
the
flavor
we
want
that
democratic
structure
to
have
voters
ultimately
determine
a
political
structure
political
structures
in
fact
outweigh
political
flavors
the
best
structural
form
of
politics
is
not
easy
to
determine
political
structure
by
itself
does
not
determine
political
content
each
structural
form
of
politics
must
be
valued
independently
the
greatest
errors
in
judging
a
person
are
made
by
his
parents
this
is
a
fact
but
how
is
one
to
explain
it
do
the
parents
have
too
much
experience
of
the
child
and
can
they
no
longer
compose
it
into
a
unity
we
notice
that
travelers
in
a
strange
land
grasp
correctly
the
common
distinctive
traits
of
a
people
only
in
the
first
period
of
their
stay
the
more
they
get
to
know
a
people
the
more
they
a
how
to
see
what
is
typical
and
distinctive
about
it
as
soon
as
they
see
up
close
they
stop
being
farsighted
might
parents
judge
their
children
wrongly
because
they
have
never
stood
far
enough
off
from
them
a
quite
different
explanation
would
be
the
following
people
tend
to
stop
thinking
about
things
that
are
closest
to
them
and
simply
b
them
when
parents
are
required
to
judge
their
children
it
is
perhaps
their
customary
thoughtlessness
that
makes
them
judge
so
mistakenly
persuasion
is
the
strategic
use
of
language
to
move
an
audience
it
works
by
appealing
to
our
emotion
as
well
as
by
appealing
to
our
reason
therefore
sometimes
you
may
try
to
appeal
to
an
emotion
in
your
audience
by
imitating
it
hysteria
by
being
hysterical
anger
by
raging
a
you
may
try
to
re
create
the
circumstances
which
excited
in
you
the
emotions
that
you
want
to
excite
in
your
audience
however
the
best
measure
is
to
appear
calm
detached
thoroughly
in
control
of
your
feelings
while
you
are
controlling
your
narrative
for
your
own
purposes
even
your
choice
of
words
should
be
selective
you
must
pay
attention
to
their
nuances
if
you
address
a
labor
union
b
it
will
make
a
great
difference
whether
you
refer
to
the

as

the

a

they
are

that
develop
late
in
the

survive
through

they

a

many
consumers
are
willing
to
pay

for
organic
foods
convinced
that
they
are
helping
the
earth
and
eating
healthier
some
experts
say
however
that
organic
farming
has
some
drawbacks
one
of
the
most
frequent
criticisms
is
that
the
crop
yields
of
organic
farms
are
much
lower
than
those
of
traditional
farms
that
because
organic
fields
suffer
more
from
weeds
and
insects
than
conventional
fields
another
argument
often
offered
by
experts
is
that
organic
farming
can
supply
food
for
niche
markets
of
wealthy
consumers
but
cannot
feed
billions
of
hungry
people
around
the
globe
only
the
careful
use
of
chemical
inputs
not
the
costly
organic
methods
can

ancient
greek
and
roman
costume
is
essentially
draped
and
presents
a
traditional
stability
and
permanence
while
it
received
certain
fashions
over
the
centuries
it
never
underwent
any
major
transformation
l
on
heuzey
the
pioneer
of
the
study
of
classical
costume
set
forth
with
exemplary
clarity
its
two
basic
principles
the
first
is
that
classical
costume
has
no
form
in
itself
as
it
consisted
of
a
simple
rectangular
piece
of
cloth
woven
in
varying
sizes
according
to
its
intended
use
and
the
height
of
the
customer
without
differentiation
between
the
sexes
the
second
is
that
this
cloth
is
always
draped
never
shaped
or
cut
and
was
worn
round
the
body
in
accordance
with
definite
rules
thus
it
was
always
fluid
and
live 
it
is
notable
that
we
find
no
evidence
in
classical
times
of
tailors
or
dressmakers

itself

exists

more
u

what

although
patience
had
received
little
formal
education
and
what
she
knew
about
art
was
mostly
self
taught
she
was
very
skilled
and
her
work
quickly
became
popular
she
was
also
a
devoted
patriot
when
the

broke
out
she
immediately
began

she
easily
picked

also
from

she
became
deeply

were

one
day
i
got
so
badly

that
i
couldn

my

attached

merely
floated

i
wasn

my

brought
in
a

at
first
i
ignored
him
but
later
began
to
show
interest
he
tried
to
help
me
swim
pushing
me
from
under
and
bringing
me
to
the
surface
despite
my
injury
i
began
making
an
effort
to
swim
soon
the

were
removed

fourteenth
century
approaches
to
music
had
a
profound
and
continuing
impact
on
music
in
later
centuries
perhaps
most
significant
was
the
invention
of
a
precise
and
unambiguous
notation
that
could
record
a
wide
variety
of
rhythms
and
allowed
music
to
be
distributed
in
writing
and
performed
accurately
wherever
it
went
we
now
take
this
for
granted
when
we
play
from
notation
and
sight
read
through
unfamiliar
music
but
it
was
a
remarkable
innovation
in
the
fourteenth
century
among
its
effects
was
that
composers
could
fix
their
music
exactly
as
they
wished
it
to
be
performed
leading
them
to
take
pride
in
authorship
the
increased
interest
in
the
individual
and
in
satisfying
the
human
senses
that
was
characteristic
of
the
age
grew
stronger
in
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
and
has
remained
important

one
of
the
most
widespread
and
basic
norms
of
human
culture
is
embodied
in
the
rule
for
reciprocation
the
rule
requires
that
one
person
try
to
repay
in
kind
what
another
person
has
provided
by
obligating
the
recipient
of
an
act
to
repayment
in
the
future
the
rule
for
reciprocation
allows
one
individual
to
give
something
to
another
with
confidence
that
it
is
not
being
lost
sociologists
have
a
desire
to
be
consistent
with
their
words

and
deeds
this
sense
of
future
obligation
within
the
rule
makes
possible

development
of
various
kinds
of

and
exchanges
that
are

the

is
that
the

among
human
societies

not

rather
among
bacteria

historians
recognizing
this
seek
to
understand
human
history
through
studying
both
developments
within
societies
and
the
way
in
which
societies
relate
to
each

bacteria

fundamentally
shape
each

as
they
interact

the

so
you
ready
to
add
a
new
member
a
furry
one
to
your
family
but
now
you
have
one
more
decision
to
make
what
kind
of
dog
should
i
get
here
are
some
tips
to
consider
when
choosing
a
dog
that
is
right
for
you
first
pick
a
dog
that
fits
your
home
bring
a
big
one
into
your
house
only
if
you
can
give
him
a
lot
of
space
second
don
buy
a
shaggy
dog
if
you
allergic
getting
a
non
shedding
dog
is
a
good
idea
if
you
worried
about
loose
hairs
or
your
kids
allergies
third
pick
a
mild
mannered
puppy
that
is
likely
to
be
more
forgiving
and
protective
of
his
little
owners
keep
these
in
mind
and
you
enjoy
having
the
new
member
at
home
switching
on
the
light
in
the
nursery
evelyn
found
her
baby
daughter
julie
tossing
feverishly
and
giving
out
odd
little
cries
she
put
her
hand
against
julie
cheeks
they
were
burning
with
an
exclamation
she
followed
her
baby
arm
down
under
the
cover
until
she
found
her
little
hand
the
whole
thumb
was
swollen
to
the
wrist
and
in
the
center
was
a
little
inflamed
sore
she
rushed
to
the
phone
doctor
foulke
the
family
physician
sounded
upset
at
being
called
out
of
bed
at
midnight
she
ran
back
to
the
nursery
to
check
on
her
daughter
taking
a
closer
look
she
found
her
thumb
to
be
somewhat
more
swollen
she
knelt
beside
the
bed
and
began
smoothing
back
julie
hair
over
and
over
you
have
to
pay
close
attention
to
someone
normal
pattern
in
order
to
notice
a
deviation
from
it
when
he
or
she
lies
sometimes
the
variation
is
as
a
subtle
subtly
as
a
pause
other
times
it
is
obvious
and
abrupt
i
recently
saw
a
news
interview
with
an
acquaintance
b
who
whom
i
was
certain
was
going
to
lie
about
a
few
particularly
sensitive
issues
and
lie
she
did
during
most
of
her
interview
she
was
calm
and
direct
but
when
she
started
lying
her
manner
changed
dramatically
she
threw
her
head
back
laughed
in
disbelief 
and
shook
her
head
back
and
forth
it
is
TRUE
that
the
questions
c
dealt
dealing
with
very
personal
issues
but
i
have
found
that
in
general
no
matter
how
touchy
the
question
if
a
person
is
telling
the
truth
his
or
her
manner
will
not
change
significantly
or
abruptly
fieldwork
is
the
hallmark
of
cultural
anthropology
it
is
the
way
we
explore
and
learn
about
the
vast
detailed
intricacy
of
human
culture
and
individual
behavior
and
it
is
importantly
the
way
in
which
most
cultural
anthropologists
earn
and
maintain
their
professional
standing
some
of
the
early
personal
accounts
of
anthropologists
in
the
field
make
fieldwork
sound
exciting
adventuresome
certainly
exotic
sometimes
easy
malinowski
the
classic
anthropological
fieldworker
describes
the
early
stages
of
fieldwork
as
a
strange
sometimes
unpleasant
sometimes
intensely
interesting
adventure
which
soon
adopts
quite
a
natural
course 
he
goes
on
to
describe
his
daily
routine
of
strolling
through
the
village
observed
the
intimate
details
of
family
life
and
as
he
tells
it
such
observations
seem
possible
and
accessible
albert
einstein
sought
relentlessly
for
a
so
called
unified
field
theory
a
theory
capable
of
describing
nature
forces
within
a
single
all
encompassing
coherent
framework
einstein
was
not
motivated
by
the
things
we
often
associate
with
scientific
undertakings
such
as
trying
to
explain
this
or
that
piece
of
experimental
data
instead
he
was
driven
by
a
passionate
belief
that
the
deepest
understanding
of
the
universe
would
reveal
its
truest
wonder
the
simplicity
and
power
of
the
principles
on
which
it
is
based
as
in
einstein
formulation
the
two
theories
underlying
the
tremendous
progress
of
physics
were
mutually
incompatible
einstein
wanted
to
illuminate
the
workings
of
the
universe
with
a
clarity
never
before
achieved
allowing
us
all
to
stand
in
awe
of
its
sheer
beauty
and
elegance
in
his
day
however
einstein
never
realized
this
dream
mainly
because
a
number
of
essential
features
of
matter
and
the
forces
of
nature
were
either
unknown
or
at
best
poorly
understood
effective
leaders
set
the
tone
for
the
entire
organization
it
not
a
matter
of
knowing
more
than
everyone
else
there
are
plenty
of
leaders
who
are
not
the
biggest
experts
in
their
companies
but
it
does
mean
working
hard
something
anyone
can
do
be
the
first
person
to
arrive
at
the
workplace
and
be
the
last
one
to
leave
if
you
can
do
that
you
will
already
be
light
years
ahead
of
most
managers
in
the
respect
you
will
gain
from
your
team
members
apply
the
same
principle
to
all
your
routine
activities
if
you
expect
your
sales
force
to
make
calls
each
day
make
calls
yourself
it
is
not
rocket
science
it
is
just
basic
lead
by
example
management
no
one
can
really
discredit
leaders
who
are
the
hardest
working
individuals
in
their
organizations
science
is
making
the
future
and
nations
are
busy
making
future
scientists
the
more
science
that
emerges
from
this
investment
the
greater
the
need
for
us
to
follow
the
gist
of
the
science
with
sufficient
understanding
in
other
words
if
we
the
ordinary
people
are
to
keep
pace
with
science
we
need
more
science
writers
and
more
science
writing
that
is
clear
wise
and
eloquent
and
that
demands
to
be
read
people
often
feel
excluded
from
science
convinced
that
it
takes
an
advanced
degree
to
understand
what
scientists
do
as
a
result
they
defensively
shrug
off
the
whole
business
as
an
exclusive
realm
of
little
relevance
to
their
lives
one
of
the
surest
cures
for
scientific
is
great
scientific
literature
writing
that
does
not
merely
translate
technical
terms
into
plain
english
or
explain
complicated
ideas
simply
if
i
assign
fifty
students
a
five
page
essay
on
the
subject
of
why
the
roman
empire
fell
most
of
them
are
likely
to
say
it
was
a
combination
of
economic
and
social
causes
ultimately
leading
to
a
weakening
of
the
frontiers
this
would
be
a
fine
answer
but
after
reading
forty
five
papers
all
saying
the
same
thing
i
ready
for
a
change
if
you
can
take
a
different
angle
from
the
rest
of
the
class
in
a
paper
you
more
likely
to
impress
your
professors
but
here
the
tricky
part
being
different
is
risky
and
it
only
works
if
you
back
up
your
argument
very
well
if
you
choose
to
argue
that
rome
fell
solely
because
christianity
weakened
the
fighting
spirit
of
the
romans
you
will
need
persuasive
reasoning
and
arguments
against
any
potential
objections
consumers
of
different
age
groups
obviously
have
very
different
needs
and
wants
although
people
who
belong
to
the
same
age
group
differ
in
many
other
ways
they
do
tend
to
share
a
set
of
values
and
common
cultural
experiences
that
they
carry
throughout
life
in
some
cases
marketers
initially
develop
a
product
to
attract
one
age
group
and
then
try
to
that
is
what
the
high
octane
energy
drink
reddox
does
the
company
aggressively
introduced
it
in
bars
nightclubs
and
gyms
to
the
product
core
audience
of
young
people
over
time
it
became
popular
in
other
contexts
and
the
company
began
to
sponsor
the
pga
european
tour
to
expand
its
reach
to
older
golfers
it
also
hands
out
free
cans
to
commuters
cab
drivers
and
car
rental
agencies
to
promote
the
drink
as
a
way
to
stay
alert
on
the
road
is
aggravated
by
the
overabundance
of
information
at
our
disposal
while
this
is
obvious
enough
in
some
realms
for
example
consider
how
much
information
is
potentially
relevant
for
estimating
the
value
of
microsoft
stock
even
when
the
information
set
seems
less
cluttered
information
overload
a
state
of
confusion
and
decision
avoidance
can
still
occur
in
one
experiment
shoppers
in
a
supermarket
were
presented
with
free
samples
of
jams
and
jellies
in
the
first
treatment
a
small
selection
was
available
for
tasting
in
the
second
a
large
selection
was
available
while
everyone
likes
the
idea
of
abundant
choice
and
indeed
the
table
with
the
greater
selection
attracted
larger
crowds
it
was
the
table
with
fewer
samples
that
led
to
the
most
sales
the
likely
reason
is
that
the
large
selection
led
to
information
overload
the
feeling
that
the
decision
was
too
complicated
for
immediate
action
difficulty
in
assessing
information
the
shortage
of
trustworthy
informants
mental
fatigue
caused
by
misleading
information
indeterminacy
arising
from
indirect
information
the
complexity
of
altering
consumer
behavior
the
essence
of
science
is
to
uncover
patterns
and
regularities
in
nature
by
finding
algorithmic
compressions
of
observations
but
the
raw
data
of
observation
rarely
exhibit
explicit
regularities
instead
we
find
that
nature
order
is
hidden
from
us
it
is
written
in
code
to
make
progress
in
science
we
need
to
crack
the
cosmic
code
to
dig
beneath
the
raw
data
and
uncover
the
hidden
order
i
often
liken
fundamental
science
to
doing
a
crossword
puzzle
experiment
and
observation
provide
us
with
clues
but
the
clues
are
cryptic
and
require
some
considerable
ingenuity
to
solve
with
each
new
solution
as
with
a
crossword
so
with
the
physical
universe
we
find
that
the
solutions
to
independent
clues
link
together
in
a
consistent
and
supportive
way
to
form
a
coherent
unity
so
that
the
more
clues
we
solve
the
easier
we
find
it
to
fill
in
the
missing
features
the
depth
of
scientific
experiments
keeps
us
in
awe
we
glimpse
a
bit
more
of
the
overall
pattern
of
nature
the
code
breaking
process
becomes
increasingly
mysterious
the
regularity
of
nature
is
revealed
in
its
entirety
to
the
observer
we
crack
the
cosmic
codes
one
by
one
replacing
an
old
solution
with
the
new
one
like
an
artist
who
pursues
both
enduring
excellence
and
shocking
creativity
great
companies
foster
a
a
between
continuity
and
change
on
the
one
hand
they
adhere
to
the
principles
that
produced
success
in
the
first
place
yet
on
the
other
hand
they
continually
evolve
modifying
their
approach
with
creative
improvements
and
intelligent
adaptation
but
the
point
here
is
not
as
simple
as
some
companies
failed
because
they
did
not
change
companies
that
change
constantly
but
without
any
consistent
rationale
will
b
just
as
surely
as
those
that
change
not
at
all
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
adhering
to
specific
practices
and
strategies
but
you
should
comprehend
the
underlying
why
behind
those
practices
and
thereby
see
when
to
keep
them
and
when
to
change
them
it
was
the
day
of
the
audition
i
hadn
slept
a
wink
the
previous
night
strangely
i
wasn
tired
it
could
have
been
the
adrenaline
pumping
through
my
veins
or
maybe
it
was
the
five
cups
of
coffee
i
drank
that
morning
either
way
i
couldn
sit
still
i
kept
getting
up
and
down
from
my
chair
pacing
around
the
room
a
dozen
thoughts
went
through
my
head
would
i
remember
my
lines
would
i
be
able
to
display
the
right
emotions
i
kept
telling
myself
to
relax
but
the
butterflies
in
my
stomach
had
an
intention
of
their
own
when
my
name
was
called

the

the

building
as
the
inscription
above
the
western
entrance
tells
us
dates
from
before
they
began
constructing
this
new
building
in
the
older
church
of
the
holy
virgin
had
burned
down
in
this
latter
church
about
which
little
is
known
is
believed
by
some
to
have
been
built
already
at
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
the
little
town
of
karli
ova
later
karlovo
in
any
case
the
names
of
priests
serving
in
the
church
have
been
preserved
from
the
eighteenth
century
on
although
the
construction
was
completed
in
the
events
of
the
crimean
war
and
lack
of
funds
delayed
the
furnishing
of
the
church
and
its
consecration
did
not
take
place
until
may
edwin
armstrong
who
first
discovered
and
developed
fm
radio
in
the
s
and
early
s
is
often
considered
the
most
prolific
and
influential
inventor
in
radio
history
he
alone
understood
the
impact
of
de
forest
vacuum
tube
and
he
used
it
to
invent
an
amplifying
system
that
enabled
radio
receivers
to
pick
up
distant
signals
armstrong
innovations
rendered
useless
the
enormous
alternators
used
for
generating
power
in
early
radio
transmitters
in
he
sold
a
super
version
of
his
circuit
to
radio
corporation
of
america
rca
for
and
sixty
thousand
shares
of
rca
stock
making
him
a
millionaire
as
well
as
rca
largest
private
stockholder
armstrong
also
worked
on
the
major
problem
of
radio
reception
electrical
interference
between
and
the
inventor
filed
five
patents
on
fm
despite
what
you
might
think
luck
isn
a
matter
of
fate
or
destiny
according
to
research
by
psychologist
richard
wiseman
instead
it
a
result
of
the
way
lucky
people
think
and
act
which
means
that
anyone
can
learn
to
be
lucky
for
instance
wiseman
found
that
lucky
people
always
take
notice
of
what
going
on
around
them
and
stay
open
to
new
experiences
and
opportunities
meanwhile
unlucky
people
tend
to
be
tenser
and
too
focused
on
certain
tasks
which
stops
them
from
noticing
opportunities
they
aren
explicitly
looking
for
so
next
time
you
heading
to
a
party
don
go
in
with
a
goal
in
mind
no
matter
how
much
you
want
to
attract
someone
instead
take
things
as
they
come
and
you
never
know
what
might
happen
you
could
even
make
some
awesome
new
friends
in
a
study
conducted
by
and
joel
aronoff
participants
were
asked
to
negotiate
with
a
seller
over
the
purchase
price
of
a
piece
of
art
toward
the
end
of
the
negotiation
the
seller
made
a
final
offer
in
one
of
two
ways
half
of
the
time
he
said
that
he
would
accept
while
the
other
half
of
the
time
he
gave
the
same
final
price
but
also
added
a
little
humor
well
my
final
offer
is
and
i
throw
in
my
pet
frog
those
few
moments
of
attempted
humor
had
a
large
effect
as
participants
made
a
much
greater
compromise
in
their
purchase
price
when
they
heard
about
the
frog
it
seemed
that
the
brief
humorous
comment
momentarily
put
the
participants
in
a
good
mood
and
encouraged
them
to
be
more
giving
the
green
revolution
was
a
mixed
blessing
over
time
farmers
came
to
rely
heavily
on
broadly
adapted
high
yield
crops
to
the
exclusion
of
varieties
adapted
to
local
conditions
monocropping
vast
fields
with
the
same
genetically
uniform
seeds
helps
boost
yield
and
meet
immediate
hunger
needs
yet
high
yield
varieties
are
also
genetically
weaker
crops
that
require
expensive
chemical
fertilizers
and
toxic
pesticides
the
same
holds
TRUE
for
high
yield
livestock
breeds
which
often
require
expensive
feed
and
medicinal
care
to
survive
in
foreign
climates
the
drive
to
increase
production
is
pushing
out
local
varieties
diluting
livestock
genetic
diversity
in
the
process
as
a
result
the
world
food
supply
has
become
largely
dependent
on
a
shrinking
list
of
breeds
designed
for
maximum
yield
in
short
in
our
focus
on
increasing
the
amount
of
food
we
produce
today
we
have
accidentally
put
ourselves
at
risk
for
food
shortages
in
the
future
about
twenty
years
ago
time
magazine
described
a
study
by
a
psychologist
of
people
who
had
lost
their
jobs
three
times
due
to
plant
closings
the
writers
were
amazed
by
what
they
discovered
they
expected
the
people
being
laid
off
to
be
beaten
down
and
discouraged
instead
they
found
them
to
be
incredibly
resilient
why
was
that
they
concluded
that
people
who
had
weathered
repeated
adversity
had
learned
to
bounce
back
people
who
had
lost
a

and
found
a
new

before

better
prepared
to
deal
with
adversity
than
someone
who
had
always
worked
at
the

place
and
had
never
faced
adversity
it
may
sound
ironic
but
if
you
have
experienced
a
lot
of
failure
you
are
actually
in
a
better
position
to
achieve
success
than

causes
of
human
despair
adversity
and
failure
an
unhealthy
combination
one
reason
why
the
definitions
of
words
have
changed
over
time
is
simply
because
of
their
misuse
there
are
a
growing
number
of
examples
where
the
incorrect
meaning
of
relatively
commonplace
language
has
become
more
widespread
than
the
original
intention
or
definition
a
now
imagine
that
an
angry
customer
sent
you
a
letter
about
the
service
he
received
in
one
of
your
stores
if
your
reply
is
that
you
perused
his
letter 
he
is
likely
to
get
even
more
angry
than
he
was
before
b
the
word
peruse
is
one
of
them
most
people
think
that
to
peruse
something
means
to
scan
or
skim
it
quickly
without
paying
much
attention 
in
fact
this
is
the
exact
opposite
of
what
peruse
really
means
to
study
or
read
something
carefully
in
detail 
c
but
the
word
has
been
misused
so
often
by
so
many
people
that
this
second
sense
of
it
the
exact
opposite
of
what
it
actually
means
has
finally
been
accepted
as
a
secondary
definition
and
as
far
as
most
people
know
it
is
the
only
definition
the

went
in
a
little
ashamed
of
selling
something
so
worthless
monsieur
he
said
to
the
dealer
i
like
you
to
value
this
piece
for
me
if
you
be
so
kind
the
man
took
the
article
examined
it
turned
it
over
weighed
it
and
took
up
a
magnifying
glass
to
look
at
it
more
closely
lantin
was
a
little
embarrassed
by
all
this
ceremony
and
was
about
to
say
look
i
pretty
sure
it
got
no
value
at
all
when
the
jeweler
announced
monsieur
i
put
it
at
between
and
francs
however
i
could
not
purchase
this
from
you
without
knowing
its
exact
provenance
when
induced
to
give
spoken
or
written
witness
to
something
they
doubt
people
will
often
feel
bad
about
their
deceit
nevertheless
they
begin
to
believe
a
what
that
they
are
saying
when
there
is
no
compelling
external
explanation
for
one
words
saying
becomes
believing
tory
higgins
and
his
colleagues
had
university
students
read
a
personality
description
of
someone
and
then
b
summarize
summarized
it
for
someone
else
who
was
believed
either
to
like
or
to
dislike
this
person
the
students
wrote
a
more
positive
description
when
the
recipient
liked
the
person
having
said
positive
things
they
also
then
liked
the
person
more
themselves
c
asked
asking
to
recall
what
they
had
read
they
remembered
the
description
as
being
more
positive
than
it
was
in
short
it
seems
that
we
are
prone
to
adjust
our
messages
to
our
listeners
and
having
done
so
to
believe
the
altered
message
we
want
to
stop
watching
so
much
tv
but
demonstrably
we
also
want
to
watch
lots
of
tv
so
what
we
really
want
it
seems
is
to
stop
wanting
we
are
trapped
deep
in
a
paradox
deciding
on
the
best
course
of
action
then
doing
something
else
the
way
around
this
is
to
see
that
habits
are
responses
to
needs
this
sounds
obvious
but
countless
efforts
at
habit
change
ignore
its
implications
if
you
eat
badly
you
might
resolve
to
start
eating
well
however
if
you
are
eating
burgers
and
ice
cream
to
feel
comforted
relaxed
and
happy
try
to
replace
them
with
broccoli
and
carrot
juice
is
like
dealing
with
a
leaky
bathroom
tap
by
repainting
the
kitchen
what
is
required
is
not
a
better
diet
but
an
alternative
way
to
feel
comforted
and
relaxed
a
way
to
get
things
done
more
efficiently
and
get
better
results
is
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
of
day
know
your
own
body
rhythm
respect
your
internal
clock
and
pay
attention
to
how
your
energy
level
ebbs
and
flows
during
the
day
if
you
have
lots
of
energy
early
in
the
morning
that
is
when
you
should
schedule
difficult
activities
whether
for
you
these
are
brainstorming
writing
or
practicing
use
the
same
principle
in
planning
activities
for
your
team
schedule
intervals
of
productive
time
and
breaks
so
that
you
get
the
most
from
people
i
always
ask
people
to
respect
their
own
body
rhythms
when
scheduling
appointments
in
my
experience
most
people
are
far
more
productive
in
the
morning
but
there
are
those
who
differ
and
hit
their
stride
later
in
the
day
since
the 
zoos
have
strived
to
reproduce
the
natural
habitats
of
their
animals
replacing
concrete
floors
and
steel
bars
with
grass
rocks
trees
and
pools
of
water
these
environments
may
simulate
the
wild
but
the
animals
do
not
have
to
worry
about
finding
food
shelter
or
safety
from
predators
while
this
may
not
seem
like
such
a
bad
deal
at
first
glance
the
animals
experience
numerous
complications
and
yet
most
of
the
complications
were
settled
with
no
delay
in
order
to
ensure
the
animals
health
and
safety
the
zebras
live
constantly
in
fear
smelling
the
lions
in
the
nearby
great
cats
exhibit
every
day
and
finding
themselves
unable
to
escape
there
is
no
possibility
of
migrating
or
of
storing
food
for
the
winter
which
must
seem
to
promise
equally
certain
doom
to
a
bird
or
bear
in
short
zoo
life
is
utterly
incompatible
with
an
animal
most
deeply
rooted
survival
instincts
the
wrapping
of
christmas
presents
william
waits
notes
is
a
fairly
recent
phenomenon
in
american
life
it
arose
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century
during
a
period
when
hand
made
presents
were
giving
way
to
machine
made
store
bought
ones
for
both
givers
and
manufacturers
this
shift
presented
a
problem
for
the
machine
made
items
precisely
because
they
were
convenient
represented
less
of
the
giver
personal
attention
than
the
hand
made
items
had
done
thus
they
were
symbolically
less
intimate
to
disguise
this
loss
of
symbolic
value
and
to
invest
the
manufactured
items
with
a
personal
touch
retailers
encouraged
shoppers
to
have
their
purchases
gift
wrapped
gift
wrapping
in
waits
acute
term
became
a
decontaminating
mechanism
that
removed
the
presents
from
the
normal
flow
of
bought
and
sold
goods
and
made
them
for
a
single
ceremonial
moment
emblems
of
rather
than
commerce
some
people
tend
to
be
late
as
a
general
rule
whether
they
are
busy
or
not
to
stop
being
late
all
one
has
to
do
is
change
the
motivation
by
deciding
that
in
all
circumstances
being
on
time
is
going
to
have
first
priority
over
any
other
consideration
presto
you
will
never
have
to
run
for
a
plane
or
miss
an
appointment
again
as
a
lifelong
latecomer
that
is
how
i
cured
myself
having
made
the
decision
that
was
now
of
major
importance
i
found
that
answers
came
automatically
to
such
questions
as
can
i
squeeze
in
one
more
errand
before
the
dentist
or
do
i
have
to
leave
for
the
airport
now
the
answers
are
always
no
and
yes
choosing
to
be
on
time
will
make
your
life
enormously
easier
and
that
of
your
family
friends
and
colleagues
as
well
the
hazards
of
migration
range
from
storms
to
starvation
but
they
are
outweighed
by
the
advantages
to
be
found
in
the
temporary
superabundance
of
food
in
the
summer
home
the
process
of
evolution
ensures
that
a
species
migrates
only
if
it
pays
it
to
do
so
birds
of
the
same
species
may
be
migratory
in
one
area
but
sedentary
elsewhere
most
song
thrushes
migrate
from
northern
scotland
but
in
the
south
of
england
the
balance
of
advantage
against
disadvantage
is
so
delicate
that
while
some
migrate
to
spain
and
portugal
the
majority
normally
over
winter
moreover
england
winters
have
been
getting
warmer
since
the
late 
and
if
the
trend
continues
it
is
likely
that
our
song
thrushes
will
become
increasingly
sedentary
some
people
believe
that
is
some
kind
of
instinct
developed
because
it
benefits
our
species
in
some
way
at
first
this
seems
like
a
strange
idea
darwin
theories
of
evolution
presume
that
individuals
should
act
to
preserve
their
own
interests
not
those
of
the
species
as
a
whole
but
the
british
evolutionary
biologist
richard
dawkins
believes
that
natural
selection
has
given
us
the
ability
to
feel
pity
for
someone
who
is
suffering
when
humans
lived
in
small
clan
based
groups
a
person
in
need
would
be
a
relative
or
someone
who
could
pay
you
back
a
good
turn
later
so
taking
pity
on
others
could
benefit
you
in
the
long
run
modern
societies
are
much
less
close
knit
and
when
we
see
a
heartfelt
appeal
for
charity
chances
are
we
may
never
even
meet
the
person
who
is
suffering
but
the
emotion
of
pity
is
still
in
our
genes
essentially
your
reputation
is
your
most
valuable
asset
so
guard
it
well
but
do
not
be
terribly
demoralized
if
you
make
some
mistakes
along
the
way
with
time
it
is
possible
to
repair
a
stained
reputation
every
experience
you
have
with
someone
else
is
like
a
drop
of
water
falling
into
a
pool
as
your
experiences
with
that
person
grow
the
drops
accumulate
and
the
pool
deepens
positive
interactions
are
clear
drops
of
water
and
negative
interactions
are
red
drops
of
water
but
they
are
not
equal
that
is
and
that
number
differs
for
different
people
those
who
are
very
forgiving
only
need
a
few
positive
experiences
clear
drops
to
dilute
a
bad
experience
while
those
who
are
less
forgiving
need
a
lot
more
to
wash
away
the
red
a
number
of
clear
drops
can
dry
up
with
time
a
drop
of
red
water
can
lead
your
life
to
ruin
a
number
of
water
drops
can
affect
your
experience
a
number
of
red
drops
can
accumulate
gradually
a
number
of
clear
drops
can
dilute
one
red
drop
when
you
are
picking
out
products
in
the
grocery
store
searching
for
the
best
possible
strawberry
jam
you
are
trying
to
maximize
your
own
enjoyment
you
are
the
only
person
that
matters
it
is
your
sense
of
pleasure
that
you
are
trying
to
please
in
this
case
a
is
the
ideal
strategy
you
should
listen
to
those
cells
in
the
brain
that
tell
you
what
you
really
want
however
when
you
are
making
a
moral
decision
this
egocentric
strategy
backfires
moral
decisions
require
taking
other
people
into
account
you
cannot
act
like
a
greedy
brute
or
let
your
anger
get
out
of
control
doing
the
right
thing
means
thinking
about
b
using
the
emotional
brain
to
mirror
the
emotions
of
strangers
selfishness
needs
to
be
balanced
by
some
selflessness
we
tend
to
consider
ourselves
as
rational
decision
makers
logically
evaluating
the
costs
and
benefits
of
each
alternative
we
encounter
a
we
are
much
more
primitive
than
most
assume
a
team
of
economists
looked
at
how
consumers
reacted
to
various
pitches
by
banks
to
take
out
a
loan
a
purely
rational
view
would
have
predicted
that
interest
rates
would
be
the
only
factor
that
had
an
impact
but
the
scientists
varied
more
than
just
the
interest
rate
they
also
tested
how
persuasive
other
approaches
might
be
b
some
letters
offered
a
chance
to
win
a
cell
phone
in
a
lottery
if
the
customer
came
in
to
inquire
about
a
loan
they
found
that
such
an
offer
increased
loan
inquiries
by
as
much
as
dropping
the
interest
rate
five
points
for
a
loan
this
meant
some
customers
were
in
essence
willing
to
pay
more
in
interest
to
receive
a
cell
phone
it
is
the
end
of
a
long
tiring
day
at
walt
disney
world
and
a
busload
of
parents
and
children
are
starting
the
twenty
minute
ride
back
to
their
hotel
the
children
are
overstimulated
and
annoyed
and
so
are
the
parents
everyone
is
whiny
it
is
a
bus
ride
from
hell
then
rising
above
the
unpleasant
buzz
of
complaining
children
and
parents
comes
a
thin
persistent
melody
the
bus
driver
has
started
to
sing
the
song
under
the
sea
from
the
movie
the
little
mermaid
everyone
begins
to
quiet
down
and
listen
eventually
a
little
girl
joins
in
then
several
more
children
by
the
end
of
the
ride
everyone
is
singing
the
circle
of
life
from
the
movie
the
lion
king
the
bus
ride
from
hell
has
become
the
pleasurable
song
filled

to
a
full
day
back
in
the 
sholes
co
a
leading
manufacturer
of
typewriters
at
the
time
received
many
a
complaints
compliments
from
users
about
typewriter
keys
sticking
together
if
the
operator
went
too
fast
in
response
management
asked
its
engineers
to
figure
out
a
way
to
prevent
this
from
happening
the
engineers
discussed
the
problem
and
then
one
of
them
said
what
if
we
b
turned
slowed
the
operator
down
if
we
did
that
the
keys
would
not
jam
together
nearly
as
much
the
result
was
to
have
an
inefficient
keyboard
configuration
for
example
the
letters
o
and
i
are
the
third
and
sixth
most
frequently
used
letters
in
the
english
language
and
yet
the
engineers
positioned
them
on
the
keyboard
so
that
the
relatively
weaker
fingers
had
to
depress
them
this
inefficient
logic
pervaded
the
keyboard
and
c
triggered
solved
the
problem
of
keyboard
jam
up
according
to
cambodian
legends
lions
once
roamed
the
countryside
attacking
villagers
and
their
precious
buffalo
and
long
before
the
great
khmer
empire
began
in
the
th
century
farmers
developed
a
fierce
martial
art
to
defend
themselves
against
the
predator
these
techniques
became
bokator
meaning
to
fight
a
lion 
bokator
is
a
martial
art
depicted
on
the
walls
of
angkor
wat
there
are
moves
to
master
mimicking
animals
such
as
monkeys
elephants
and
even
ducks
king
jayavarman
vii
the
warrior
king
who
united
cambodia
in
the
th
century
made
his
army
train
in
bokator
turning
it
into
a
fearsome
fighting
force
despite
its
long
tradition
in
cambodia
bokator
flourished
when
the
khmer
rouge
took
power
in
and
executed
most
of
the
discipline
masters
over
the
next
four
years
while
in
japan
i
ordered
green
tea
with
sugar
at
a
restaurant
a
waiter
politely
explained
that
one
does
not
drink
green
tea
with
sugar
i
responded
that
i
was
aware
of
this
custom
but
i
liked
my
tea
sweet
the
waiter
took
up
the
issue
with
the
manager
after
a
lengthy
conversation
the
manager
came
over
and
said
i
very
sorry
we
don
have
sugar
disappointed
i
changed
my
order
to
a
cup
of
coffee
which
the
waiter
soon
brought
over
resting
on
the
saucer
were
two
packets
of
sugar
my
failure
to
obtain
a
cup
of
sweet
green
tea
was
due
to
a
fundamental
difference
in
our
ideas
about
choice
in
america
a
paying
customer
has
every
right
to
have
a
request
met
but
from
a
japanese
perspective
it
is
their
duty
to
protect
those
who
do
not
know
any
better
after
a
stressful
day
how
do
you
wind
down
and
clear
your
mind
relaxing
in
a
comfortable
chair
putting
on
some
soothing
sounds
and
reading
something
light
and
entertaining
are
all
good
methods
to
get
ready
for
some
restful
sleep
but
as
you
ease
your
exhausted
senses
do
not
forget
your
sense
of
smell
certain
aromas
can
fill
you
with
feelings
of
tranquility
and
research
has
found
that
lavender
vanilla
and
green
apple
are
among
the
best
smells
to
help
lower
anxiety
and
induce
sleep
you
can
use
essential
oils
of
these
scents
by
applying
them
to
the
back
of
your
neck
or
the
inside
of
your
wrist
even
better
indulge
in
a
warm
bath
with
these
oils
dissolved
in
the
water
before
bed
you
might
enjoy
a
glass
of
hot
soy
milk
with
natural
vanilla
flavoring
for
a
calming

here
is
a
surprise
for
you
being
happy
means
that
you
realize
that
there
are
times
that
you
will
be
unhappy
and
recognize
that
life
sometimes
stinks
what
is
uplifting
in
those
times
is
appreciating
life
and
facing
the
challenges
that
come
with
it
realizing
that
you
are
facing
challenges
fellow
humans
have
also
faced
we
are
not
saying
you
should
lower
your
expectations
for
your
so
called
perfect
life
or
downsize
your
goals
we
just
believe
that
if
you
can
align
your
expectations
with
reality
a
little
more
by
expecting
to
face
challenges
you
will
be
better
off
in
the
end
there
is
an
interesting
biological
reinforcement
for
this
notion
too
your
levels
of
c
reactive
protein

marker
of
damaging
inflammation
have
been
shown
to
be
higher
when
you
have
expectations
that
are
unattainable
the
greek
philosopher
socrates
observed
the
unexamined
life
is
not
worth
living
for
most
people
however
reflection
and
self
examination
do
not
come
naturally
as
much
as
any
other
kind
of
thinking
reflection
requires
solitude
distraction
and
reflection
simply
do
not
mix
it
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
can
do
well
near
a
television
while
the
phone
is
ringing
or
with
children
in
the
same
room
one
of
the
reasons
i
have
been
able
to
accomplish
much
and
keep
growing
personally
is
that
i
have
not
only
set
aside
time
to
reflect
but
i
have
separated
myself
from
distractions
for
short
blocks
of
time
thirty
minutes
in
the
spa
an
hour
outside
on
a
rock
in
my
backyard
or
a
few
hours
in
a
comfortable
chair
in
my
office
the
place
does
not
matter
as
long
as
you
remove
yourself
from
distractions
and
interruptions
virtuoso
violinist
pinchas
zukerman
was
giving
a
master
class
to
a
group
of
young
artists
who
had
come
to
the
aspen
music
festival
from
all
over
the
world
the
auditorium
was
filled
with
aspiring
artists
distinguished
teachers
and
well
known
performers
the
atmosphere
was
competitive
and
electric
as
each
performer
played
zukerman
offered
friendly
advice
and
encouragement
invariably
picking
up
his
own
violin
to
demonstrate
finer
points
of
technique
the
last
musician
performed
brilliantly
when
the
applause
subsided
zukerman
complimented
the
artist
then
picked
up
his
own
violin
tucked
it
under
his
chin
paused
a
long
moment
and
then
without
playing
a
note
or
uttering
a
word
he
placed
the
instrument
back
in
its
case
the
audience
responded
with
deafening
applause
in
recognition
of
this
master
musician
who
could
pay
so
gracious
a
compliment
whenever
you
stand
on
a
scale
in
your
bathroom
or
place
a
melon
on
a
scale
at
the
grocery
store
you
are
measuring
weight
an
object
weight
is
the
force
exerted
on
it
by
gravity
usually
the
earth
gravity
when
you
stand
on
a
bathroom
scale
the
scale
measures
just
how
much
upward
force
it
must
exert
on
you
in
order
to
keep
you
from
moving
downward
toward
the
earth
center
as
in
most
scales
you
will
encounter
the
bathroom
scale
uses
a
spring
to
provide
this
upward
support
if
you
are
stationary
you
are
not
accelerating
so
your
downward
weight
and
the
upward
force
from
the
spring
must
cancel
one
another
that
is
they
must
be
equal
in
magnitude
but
opposite
in
direction
so
that
they
sum
to
zero
net
force
a
few
years
ago
we
purchased
a
brand
new
camper
van
not
long
after
we
bought
our
camper
a
friend
of
ours
asked
if
her
family
could
borrow
it
we
were
not
too
interested
in
loaning
out
our
spotless
camper
so
we
declined
a
that
in
itself
would
not
have
been
so
bad
had
it
not
been
for
the
mice
mice
were
attracted
by
the
food
and
they
shredded
all
the
curtains
screens
and
cushions
had
we
let
the
friend
borrow
the
camper
she
would
have
discovered
the
boxes
before
the
mice
did
b
this
happened
in
the
fall
and
we
stored
the
camper
in
our
backyard
all
that
winter
in
the
spring
my
husband
and
i
were
setting
it
up
to
prepare
for
a
trip
c
we
were
very
surprised
to
find
that
we
had
left
cookie
boxes
in
the
camper
over
the
winter
we
had
moved
and
had
a
baby
that
previous
summer
and
fall
and
cleaning
out
the
camper
had
been
overlooked
but
when
ice
forms
they
can
walk
out
to
a
hole
near
where
the
seals
are
swimming
then
sit
and
wait
for
a
seal
to
pop
its
head
up
to
breathe
across
the
arctic
polar
bear
numbers
are
in
decline
if
the
climate
continues
to
warm
at
the
current
rate
the
bears
could
disappear
completely
in
the
next
hundred
years
but
for
now
if
you
visit
churchill
canada
in
october
or
november
it
almost
a
sure
thing
you
see
a
polar
bear
in
the
wild
churchill
population
sits
on
the
edge
of
hudson
bay
at
the
point
where
the
ice
first
forms
every
winter
and
these
bears
love
ice
their
fondness
for
frozen
seas
is
simple
ice
means
they
can
eat
their
favorite
meal
seals
although
polar
bears
are
powerful
marine
mammals
able
to
swim
a
hundred
miles
or
more
nonstop
they
too
slow
to
catch
a
seal
in
open
water
or
as
a
bear
might
put
it
dinner
is
served
behavioral
evidence
for
separate
types
of
taste
receptors
comes
from
studies
of
the
following
type
soak
your
tongue
for
seconds
in
a
sour
solution
such
as
unsweetened
lemon
juice
then
try
tasting
some
other
sour
solution
such
as
dilute
vinegar
you
will
find
that
the
second
solution
tastes
less
sour
than
usual
depending
on
the
concentrations
of
the
lemon
juice
and
vinegar
the
second
solution
may
not
taste
sour
at
all
this
phenomenon
called
adaptation
reflects
the
fatigue
of
receptors
sensitive
to
sour
tastes
now
try
tasting
something
salty
sweet
or
bitter
these
substances
taste
about
the
same
as
usual
in
short
you
experience
little
cross
adaptation
reduced
response
to
one
taste
after
exposure
to
another
evidently
the
sour
receptors
are
different
from
the
other
taste
receptors
similarly
you
can
show
that
salt
receptors
are
different
from
the
others
and
so
forth
the
fact
that
the
intensity
of
a
taste
is
a
after
trying
the
same
taste
but
not
after
trying
a
different
taste
serves
as
evidence
for
the
existence
of
b
receptors
for
different
tastes
my

up

i
was
pleased
to
receive
your
letter
requesting
a
letter
of
reference
for
a
future
leaders
scholarship
as
your
physics
teacher
i
can
certainly
speak
highly
of
your
academic
abilities
your
grades
have
consistently
been
a
and
b
in
my
class
since
this
is
the
first
semester
that
i
have
had
you
in
class
however
i
do
not
feel
that
i
am
the
right
person
to
provide
information
on
your
leadership
skills
i
would
encourage
you
to
request
a
reference
letter
from
those
teachers
with
whom
you
have
had
the
most
opportunity
to
demonstrate
those
skills
i
am
sure
many
teachers
would
be
willing
to
provide
letters
for
you
good
luck
with
your
scholarship
there
was
a
girl
who
grew
flowers
in
new
jersey
and
sometimes
took
flowers
to
customers
on
staten
island
to
get
there
she
had
to
go
over
a
bridge
paying
a
toll
of
one
day
as
she
was
approaching
the
toll
booth
she
saw
a
toll
booth
attendant
who
reminded
her
of
her
mother
as
she
reached
in
her
pocket
she
found
she
had
no
money
but
a
half
dollar
not
knowing
what
to
do
she
handed
the
coin
to
her
and
asked
nervously
want
to
buy
a
fresh
red
rose
the
attendant
looked
surprised
at
first
but
glancing
at
the
cars
piling
up
behind
her
she
took
two
dollars
from
her
purse
and
rang
it
up
on
the
cash
register
yes
i
take
it
she
said
with
a
smile
and
i
suppose
the
price
is
two
dollars
even
right
the
phrase
jack
of
all
trades
is
a
shortened
version
of
jack
of
all
trades
and
master
of
none 
it
refers
to
those
who
claim
to
be
proficient
at
countless
tasks
but
cannot
perform
a
single
one
of
them
well
the
phrase
was
first
used
in
england
at
the
start
of
the
industrial
revolution
a
large
number
of
efficiency
experts
set
up
shop
in
london
advertising
themselves
as
knowledgeable
about
every
type
of
new
manufacturing
process
trade
and
business
for
a
substantial
fee
they
would
impart
their
knowledge
to
their
clients
but
it
soon
became
evident
that
their
knowledge
was
limited
and
of
no
practical
value
doubtful
industrialists
started
calling
these
self
appointed
experts
jacks
of
all
trades
and
masters
of
none 
these
experts
are
still
with
us
and
as
a
result
so
does
the
phrase
mr
potter
was
sailing
for
europe
on
one
of
the
greatest
transatlantic
ocean
liners
when
he
went
on
board
he
found
a
another
other
passenger
was
to
share
the
cabin
with
him
after
going
to
see
the
accommodations
he
came
up
to
the
purser
desk
and
inquired
b
if
that
he
could
leave
his
valuables
in
the
ship
safe
mr
potter
explained
that
ordinarily
he
never
availed
himself
of
that
privilege
but
he
had
been
to
his
cabin
and
had
met
the
man
who
was
to
occupy
the
other
bed
judging
from
his
appearance
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
not
be
a
very
trustworthy
person
the
purser
accepted
the
responsibility
for
the
valuables
and
c
remarking
remarked
it
all
right
i
be
very
glad
to
take
care
of
them
for
you
the
other
man
has
been
up
here
and
left
his
valuables
for
the
same
reason
geothermal
heat
generated
inside
the
earth
helps
keep
the
temperature
of
the
ground
at
a
depth
of
several
meters
at
a
nearly
constant
temperature
of
about
c
to
c
this
constant
temperature
can
be
used
to
cool
and
heat
buildings
by
using
a
heat
pump
a
heat
pump
contains
a
water
filled
loop
of
pipe
which
is
buried
to
a
depth
where
the
temperature
is
nearly
constant
in
summer
warm
water
from
the
building
is
pumped
through
the
pipe
down
into
the
ground
since
the
underground
temperature
is
lower
than
the
air
temperature
however
far
more
use
is
made
of
geothermal
energy
for
direct
heat
than
any
other
source
of
energy
the
water
cools
and
then
is
pumped
back
to
the
building
where
it
absorbs
more
heat
and
the
cycle
is
repeated
comparing
yourself
with
others
is
natural
and
can
be
motivational
however
too
much
of
it
leads
to
envy
especially
if
you
ungenerous
toward
yourself
instead
try
measuring
your
present
self
against
your
past
self
when
i
asked
a
salesperson
to
map
his
sales
performance
he
was
amazed
to
see
that
he
had
achieved
a
to
annual
increase
in
sales
while
at
his
firm
this
made
him
feel
more
self
confident
and
lessened
his
resentment
toward
his
colleagues
if
you
feel
threatened
every
time
a
perceived
rival
does
well
remind
yourself
of
your
own
strengths
and
successes
michael
dared
to
look
inside
the
window
but
from
the
deep
shadow
of
the
trees
and
the
gloom
within
he
could
not
clearly
make
out
the
objects
within
although
every
nerve
in
his
body
cautioned
otherwise
he
slowly
pushed
open
the
door
the
door
creaked
as
it
swung
back
as
he
carefully
took
a
step
inside
the
door
slammed
shut
michael
futile
attempts
to
open
the
door
only
increased
his
panic
he
tried
to
calm
his
thundering
heart
by
repeating
to
himself
i
am
not
afraid
i
am
not
afraid
but
to
no
avail
he
suddenly
felt
an
uneasy
darkness
consume
him
from
within
he
opened
his
mouth
to
call
for
help
but
his
words
failed
him
errors
and
failures
typically
corrupt
all
human
designs
indeed
the
failure
of
a
single
component
of
your
car
engine
could
force
you
to
call
for
a
tow
truck
similarly
a
tiny
wiring
error
in
your
computer
circuits
can
mean
throwing
the
whole
computer
out
natural
systems
are
different
though
throughout
earth
history
an
estimated
million
to
million
species
have
disappeared
which
means
that
this
year
somewhere
between
three
and
a
hundred
species
will
vanish
however
such
natural
extinctions
appear
to
cause
little
harm
over
millions
of
years
the
ecosystem
has
developed
an
amazing
to
errors
and
failures
surviving
even
such
drastic
events
as
the
impact
of
the
yucatan
meteorite
which
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
species
unlike
deviance
in
other
settings
deviance
in
sports
often
involves
norms
and
expectations
for
example
most
north
americans
see
playing
football
as
a
positive
activity
young
men
are
encouraged
to
be
all
they
can
be
as
football
players
and
to
live
by
slogans
such
as
there
is
no
i
in
t
e
a
m
they
are
encouraged
to
increase
their
weight
and
strength
so
that
they
can
play
more
effectively
and
contribute
to
the
success
of
their
teams
when
young
men
go
too
far
in
their
acceptance
of
expectations
to
become
bigger
and
stronger
when
they
are
so
committed
to
playing
football
and
improving
their
skills
on
the
field
that
they
use
muscle
building
drugs
they
become
deviant
this
type
of
overdoing
it
deviance
is
dangerous
but
it
is
grounded
in
completely
different
social
dynamics
from
the
dynamics
that
occur
in
the
antisocial
deviance
enacted
by
alienated
young
people
who
reject
commonly
accepted
rules
and
expectations
a
disciplined
control
of
the
desire
to
avoid
wasted
efforts
and
resources
in
establishing
ambitious
attempts
to
get
independent
of
and
free
from
a
traditional
approach
of
matching
slogans
and
mottos
with
an
unquestioned
acceptance
of
and
extreme
conformity
to
time
pressure
leads
to
frustration
and
when
we
are
frustrated
or
experience
other
negative
emotions
our
thinking
becomes
narrower
and
less
creative
however
people
are
unaware
of
this
phenomenon
and
live
under
the
illusion
that
when
they
are
experiencing
time
pressure
they
are
also
more
creative
this
explains
why
time
pressure
is
pervasive
and
to
some
extent
accounts
for
the
increase
in
rates
of
depression
we
are
generally
too
busy
trying
to
squeeze
more
and
more
activities
into
less
and
less
time
consequently
we
fail
to
enjoy
potential
sources
of
happiness
that
may
be
all
around
us
to
enjoy
the
richness
that
life
has
to
offer
with
no
attempt
there
can
be
no
failure
and
with
no
failure
no
humiliation
so
our
self
esteem
in
this
world
depends
entirely
on
what
we
back
ourselves
to
be
and
do
it
is
determined
by
the
ratio
of
our
actualities
to
our
supposed
potentialities
thus
this
illustrates
how
every
rise
in
our
levels
of
expectation
entails
a
rise
in
the
dangers
of
humiliation
what
we
understand
to
be
normal
is
critical
in
determining
our
chances
of
happiness
it
also
hints
at
two
ways
for
raising
our
self
esteem
on
the
one
hand
we
may
try
to
achieve
more
and
on
the
other
we
may
reduce
the
number
of
things
we
want
to
achieve
the
advantages
of
the
latter
approach
lie
in
the
following
statement
to
give
up
pretensions
is
as
blessed
a
relief
as
to
get
them
gratified
a
for
many
people
nature
is
defined
as
a
negative
it
exists
where
people
do
not
nature
lies
outside
the
urban
and
agricultural
realms
in
regions
of
earth
where
natural
processes
are
unhindered
nature
is
where
fallen
logs
rot
and
acorns
grow
wildfires
turn
woodlands
into
meadows
and
barrier
islands
shift
with
the
currents
all
without
human
interference
by
extension
this
definition
suggests
that
nature
is
best
protected
by
keeping
humans
far
away
so
that
it
can
continue
to
run
itself
but
there
is
a
serious
problem
with
this
view
if
nature
is
defined
as
a
landscape
uninfluenced
by
humankind
then
prehistoric
peoples
changed
their
surrounding
ecosystems
whether
by
installing
orchards
in
the
amazon
or
by
hunting
many
large
mammals
to
extinction
in
north
america
and
modern
humans
are
changing
the
global
environment
even
more
profoundly
whether
through
planet
wide
climate
change
or
by
the
worldwide
movement
of
synthetic
chemicals
through
the
food
chain
the
most
obvious
salient
feature
of
moral
agents
is
a
capacity
for
rational
thought
this
is
an
uncontested
necessary
condition
for
any
form
of
moral
agency
since
we
all
accept
that
people
who
are
incapable
of
reasoned
thought
cannot
be
held
morally
responsible
for
their
actions
however
if
we
move
beyond
this
uncontroversial
salient
feature
of
moral
agents
then
the
most
salient
feature
of
actual
flesh
and
blood
as
opposed
to
ridiculously
idealized
individual
moral
agents
is
surely
the
fact
that
every
moral
agent
every
moral
problem
situation
that
is
there
is
no
one
size
fits
all
answer
to
the
question
what
are
the
basic
ways
in
which
moral
agents
wish
to
affect
others
rather
moral
agents
wish
to
affect
others
in
different
ways
depending
upon
who
these
others
are
brings
multiple
perspectives
to
bear
on
seeks
an
uncontroversial
cure
all
solution
to
follows
the
inevitable
fate
of
becoming
idealized
in
comes
with
prejudices
when
assessing
the
features
of
sacrifices
moral
values
to
avoid
being
held
responsible
for
when
it
comes
to
food
choices
young
people
are
particularly
a
vulnerable
immune
to
peer
influences
a
teenage
girl
may
eat
nothing
but
a
lettuce
salad
for
lunch
even
though
she
will
become
hungry
later
because
that
is
what
her
friends
are
eating
a
slim
boy
who
hopes
to
make
the
wrestling
team
may
routinely
overload
his
plate
with
foods
that
are
b
dense
deficient
in
carbohydrates
and
proteins
to
bulk
up
like
the
wrestlers
of
his
school
an
overweight
teen
may
eat
c
greedily
moderately
while
around
his
friends
but
then
devour
huge
portions
when
alone
few
young
people
are
completely
free
of
food
related
pressures
from
peers
whether
or
not
these
pressures
are
imposed
intentionally
it
is
said
that
although
people
laugh
in
the
same
way
they
don
necessarily
laugh
at
the
same
things
if
this
is
TRUE
of
a
single
community
it
is
even
more
TRUE
of
people
who
live
in
different
societies
because
the
topics
that
people
find
amusing
and
the
occasions
that
are
regarded
as
appropriate
for
joking
can
vary
enormously
from
one
society
to
the
next
some
styles
of
humor
with
silly
actions
are
guaranteed
to
raise
a
laugh
everywhere
but
because
of
their
reliance
on
shared
assumptions
most
jokes
travel
very
well
this
is
particularly
noticeable
in
the
case
of
jokes
that
involve
a
play
on
words
they
are
difficult
and
in
some
cases
virtually
impossible
to
translate
into
other
languages
therefore
this
is
why
people
attempts
to
tell
jokes
to
foreigners
are
so
often
met
with
blank
stares
many
grocery
stores
give
the
shopper
the
option
of
paper
or
plastic
grocery
bags
many
people
instinctively
say
that
paper
is
less
harmful
to
the
environment
after
all
paper
is
biodegradable
and
recyclable
a
most
plastic
is
manufactured
using
oil
by
products
and
natural
gas
plastic
is
not
always
easily
or
economically
recyclable
and
once
manufactured
plastic
may
last
virtually
indefinitely
yet
in
the
united
states
paper
products
are
the
single
largest
component
of
municipal
waste
even
though
paper
products
may
theoretically
be
biodegradable
in
most
landfills
they
do
not
biodegrade
b
paper
production
emits
air
pollution
specifically
percent
more
pollution
than
the
production
of
plastic
bags
and
consider
that
making
paper
uses
trees
that
could
be
absorbing
carbon
dioxide
the
paper
bag
making
process
also
results
in
three
times
more
water
pollutants
than
making
plastic
bags
while
predictions
about
the
future
are
always
difficult
one
can
be
made
with
certainty
people
will
find
themselves
in
large
numbers
of
interactions
where
intercultural
communication
skills
will
be
essential
there
are
several
reasons
for
such
prediction
some
reasons
include
increasing
amounts
of
contact
brought
on
by
overseas
assignments
in
the
business
world
the
movement
of
college
students
spending
time
in
other
countries
and
increasing
amounts
of
international
travel
among
tourists
others
relate
to
social
changes
within
any
one
large
and
complex
nation
affirmative
action
the
movement
of
immigrants
and
refugees
bilingual
education
programs
and
movement
away
from
the
goal
that
ethnic
minorities
become
a
part
of
a
melting
pot 
therefore
it
is
essential
that
people
research
the
cultures
and
communication
conventions
of
those
whom
they
propose
to
meet
in
the
future
a
famous
psychiatrist
was
leading
a
symposium
on
the
methods
of
getting
patients
to
open
up
about
themselves
the
psychiatrist
challenged
his
colleagues
with
a
boast
i
bet
that
my
technique
will
enable
me
to
get
a
new
patient
to
talk
about
the
most
private
things
during
the
first
session
without
my
having
to
ask
a
question
what
was
his
magic
formula
simply
this
he
began
the
session
by
revealing
to
the
patient
something
personal
about
himself
secrets
with
which
the
patient
might
damage
the
doctor
by
breaking
the
confidence
as
he
was
maskless 
patients
began
to
talk
about
their
lives
they
opened
themselves
up
to
him
because
he
had
become
an
open
minded
person
himself
and
openness
evoked
openness
the
same
principle
applies
to
all
human
relationships
if
you
dare
to
take
the
initiative
in
self
revelation
the
other
person
is
much
more
likely
to
reveal
secrets
to
you
being
frank
with
patients
with
serious
illness
opening
up
oneself
to
draw
out
the
other
person

of
confidentiality

and

of

the

the

of
the
respondents
with
five
prominent
social

in
and
according
to
the
graph
the
social
media
that
was
the
most
familiar
in
was
blogging
in
the
following
year
social
networking
became
the
most
familiar
social

video
blogging
which
was
the

social

in
showed
the
biggest
increase
in

among
the

a
bigger

and

were
the

social
media
during
the
early
s
a
team
of
italian
scientists
carried
out
a
series
of
studies
under
a
variety
of
circumstances
on
the
ticklishness
of
people
the
researchers
found
that
people
seem
to
have
one
foot
that
is
more
ticklish
than
the
other
and
for
most
people
it
is
the
right
the
experiment
was
repeated
in
using
a
special
way
that
a
pointed
nylon
rod
was
stroked
across
the
bottom
of
the
foot
three
times
at
intervals
of
a
second
after
applying
it
to
thirty
four
people
the
researchers
confirmed
the
original
finding
and
pushed
back
the
frontiers
of
knowledge
still
further
by
showing
that
males
were
more
ticklish
than
females
one
suggested
explanation
is
that
the
left
side
of
the
brain
which
detects
stimuli
applied
to
the
right
foot
is
associated
with
positive
emotions
such
as
laughter
buffon
was
a
famous
zoologist
and
botanist
during
the
reign
of
the
french
monarch
louis
buffon
stocked
the
park
at
versailles
with
wild
animals
he
also
expanded
the
botanical
garden
on
the
left
bank
in
paris
and
with
the
confidence
that
goes
with
being
a
great
collector
he
began
writing
a
comprehensive
natural
history
of
the
world
in
that
work
buffon
expressed
the
biased
opinion
that
native
animals
of
the
new
world
are
smaller
than
those
of
europe
that
there
are
fewer
species
of
animals
in
america
and
that
even
domesticated
species
of
european
animals
diminished
in
size
and
vigor
upon
crossing
the
atlantic
obviously
his
opinions
were
not
well
received
and
were
severely
criticized
in
america
after
an
event
all
one
has
are
memories
of
it
because
most
waits
expect
a
desired
outcome
it
is
the
memory
of
the
outcome
that
dominates
not
the
intermediate
components
if
the
overall
outcome
is
pleasurable
enough
any
unpleasantness
suffered
along
the
way
is
minimized

mitchell
and
leigh
thompson
call
this
rosy
retrospection 
mitchell
and
his
colleagues
studied
participants
in
a
day
tour
of
europe
students
going
home
for
thanksgiving
vacation
and
a
three
week
bicycle
tour
across
california
in
all
of
these
cases
the
results
were
similar
before
an
event
people
looked
forward
with
positive
anticipation
afterward
they
remembered
fondly
during
well
reality
seldom
lives
up
to
expectations
so
plenty
of
things
go
wrong
as
memory
takes
over
however
the
unpleasantness
fades
and
the
good
parts
remain
perhaps
to
intensify
and
even
get
amplified
beyond
reality
every
day
it
seems
we
learn
of
an
apology
from
a
prominent
figure
in
response
to
an
indiscretion
of
some
sort
those
in
the
public
eye
have
an
unfortunate
tendency
to
apologize
only
after
they
have
been
found
with
a
hand
in
the
cookie
jar
when
this
happens
it
is
only
natural
for
a
skeptical
public
to
wonder
are
they
apologizing
for
their
conduct
or
simply
because
they
were
caught
to
make
matters
worse
the
wrongdoer
will
often
use
the
passive
voice
in
his
or
her
apology
mistakes
were
made
rather
than
i
made
a
mistake
it
is
more
comfortable
to
use
the
passive
voice
here
but
doing
so
relinquishes
any
sense
of
personal
responsibility
it
is
a
non
apology
and
is
not
very
meaningful
we
can
infer
that
there
was
prosperity
in
ancient
athens
because
this
was
a
time
that
saw
the
planting
of
many
olive
trees
since
olive
trees
do
not
produce
their
fruits
for
about
thirty
years
their
planting
indicates
that
people
were
optimistic
about
the
future
the
growth
in
the
export
of
olive
oil
also
encouraged
the
development
of
pottery
in
which
the
oil
was
transported
about
b
c
came
the
invention
of
red
figure
vase
painting
now
the
whole
surface
of
the
vase
was
blackened
with
figures
picked
out
in
the
natural
red
this
allowed
much
more
variety
and
realism
and
the
prosperity
brought
about
by
the
international
trade
in
olive
oil
spread
to
the
peasants
and
it
was
their
rituals
with
choral
song
and
mimic
dancing
that
formed
the
basis
of
early
theater
until
recently
it
was
generally
assumed
that
the
first
humans
took
a
northerly
route
to
leave
the
african
continent
walking
into
the
middle
east
and
then
spreading
out
from
there
however
mtdna
analysis
now
suggests
the
exodus
may
have
proceeded
via
a
more
southerly
route
in
an
international
team
of
researchers
announced
that
an
isolated
group
living
in
malaysia
appeared
to
be
the
descendants
of
humans
who
left
africa
around
years
ago
according
to
the
researchers
climatic
change
underway
at
the
time
would
have
made
a
southerly
route
easier
the
genetic
evidence
suggests
perhaps
as
few
as
several
hundred
individuals
went
first
to
india
then
southeast
asia
and
australasia
if
correct
this
would
explain
why
humans
appear
to
have
reached
australia
around
years
ago
while
the
oldest
human
remains
in
europe
a
jawbone
found
in
romania
are
only
around
years
old
even
worse
than
reaching
a
conclusion
with
just
a
little
evidence
is
the
fallacy
of
reaching
a
conclusion
without
any
evidence
at
all
sometimes
people
mistake
a
separate
event
for
a
cause
and
effect
relationship
a
you
therefore
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
the
man
in
the
black
jacket
has
robbed
the
bank
however
such
a
leap
tends
to
land
far
from
the
truth
of
the
matter
you
have
absolutely
no
evidence
only
a
suspicion
based
on
coincidence
this
is
a
post
hoc
fallacy
b
they
see
that
a
happened
before
b
so
they
mistakenly
assume
that
a
caused
b
this
is
an
error
known
in
logic
as
a
post
hoc
fallacy
c
for
example
suppose
you
see
a
man
in
a
black
jacket
hurry
into
a
bank
you
notice
that
he
is
nervously
carrying
his
briefcase
and
a
few
moments
later
you
hear
a
siren
the
clanhouse
usually
consists
of
a
room
adjoining
the
dwelling
of
the
senior
female
member
of
the
clan
hopi
religion
features
a
ritual
calendar
that
includes
a
large
number
of
annually
required
ceremonies
in
most
cases
each
ceremony
is
owned
by
the
members
of
a
certain
clan
every
clan
represented
in
a
village
has
a
clanhouse
in
which
the
masks
and
other
sacred
items
used
in
the
ceremonies
are
kept
when
not
in
use
this
woman
is
in
charge
of
storing
ritual
equipment
and
of
seeing
to
it
that
they
are
treated
with
the
proper
respect
there
is
also
a
male
head
of
each
clan
whose
duties
likewise
are
partly
religious
because
he
is
in
charge
of
the
performance
of
ceremonies
owned
by
his
clan
a
male
clan
head
passes
his
position
down
to
either
his
younger
brother
or
his
sister
son
in
this
way
culturally
important
ritual
knowledge
is
kept
within
the
clan
the
information
processing
model
emphasizes
rational
analysis
for
solving
problems
with
an
emphasis
on
techniques
for
quickly
arriving
at
a
solution
culturally
this
orientation
fits
well
with
the
kinds
of
mental
attributes
which
are
normally
valued
by
contemporary
western
societies
for
example
westerners
tend
to
admire
someone
who
is
independent
and
quick
thinking
but
these
characteristics
are
not
universally
valued
agricultural
african
societies
for
example
valued
looking
at
the
problem
in
the
context
of
the
whole
society
noting
its
impact
on
various
features
of
life
in
most
situations
speed
in
arriving
at
a
solution
was
not
a
vital
issue
this
is
also
found
with
the
cree
and
ojibway
in
canada
these
groups
historically
lived
in
wilderness
areas
and
faced
many
hardships
in
these
circumstances
they
would
rarely
get
a
second
chance
at
solving
problems
consequently
these
native
people
value
taking
time
to
reflect
on
a
problem
and
mentally
walk
through
possible
solutions
before
any
action
is
taken
the
other
day
an
acquaintance
of
mine
a
sociable
and
charming
man
told
me
he
had
found
himself
unexpectedly
alone
in
new
york
for
an
hour
or
two
between
appointments
he
went
to
the
whitney
museum
and
spent
the
empty
time
looking
at
things
by
himself
for
him
it
proved
to
be
a
shock
nearly
as
great
as
falling
in
love
to
discover
that
he
could
enjoy
himself
so
much
alone
what
had
he
been
afraid
of
i
asked
myself
that
suddenly
alone
he
would
discover
that
he
bored
himself
or
that
there
was
quite
simply
no
self
there
to
meet
but
having
taken
the
first
step
into
this
new
world
he
is
now
about
to
begin
a
new
adventure
he
is
about
to
be
launched
into
his
own
inner
space
space
as
immense
unexplored
and
sometimes
frightening
as
outer
space
to
the
astronaut
his
every
perception
will
come
to
him
with
a
new
freshness
and
for
a
time
seem
startlingly
for
anyone
who
can
see
things
for
himself
with
a
naked
eye
becomes
for
a
moment
or
two
something
of
a
genius
with
another
human
being
present
vision
becomes
double
vision
inevitably
we
are
busy
wondering
what
does
my
companion
see
or
think
of
this
and
what
do
i
think
of
it
the
original
impact
gets
lost
music
i
heard
with

was

and
therefore

it

i
have
seen
people
who
are
very
good
at
their
jobs
but
are
poor
at
presenting
themselves
and
hence
do
not
convince
the
audience
of
their
capabilities
presentation
is
so
crucially
important
and
will
make
the
difference
between
getting
a
sale
or
not
some
people
are
naturally
good
presenters
but
brushing
up
on
your
skills
in
this
area
will
prove
profitable
there
are
lots
of
courses
available
that
are
good
try
think
business
where
courses
are
cheap
or
even
free
the
abc
marketing
institute
also
offers
very
good
presentation
skills
courses
a
good
course
will
help
you
structure
your
presentations
and
improve
your
own
personal
style
i
would
recommend
one
that
films
you
while
you
are
presenting
and
then
gives
a
critique
of
your
style
john
was
as
famous
for
his
tennis
skills
as
he
was
for
his
fits
of
temper
on
the
court
one
afternoon
i
was
playing
an
important
singles
match
against
john
when
things
didn
go
his
way
he
began
to
go
downhill
complaining
about
the
game
screaming
at
himself
and
slamming
his
racket
it
looked
like
he
was
having
a
public
nervous
breakdown
in
the
end
the
guy
who
didn
deserve
to
be
on
the
same
court
with
him
won
in
three
tough
sets
after
the
match
john
announced
his
retirement
from
tennis
at
the
age
of
twenty
seven
he
explained
when
i
start
losing
to
players
like
him
i
got
to
reconsider
what
i
doing
even
playing
this
game
if
he
thought
i
be
insulted
he
was
wrong
in
fact
i
loved
it
sir
arthur
conan
doyle
the
creator
of
sherlock
holmes
had
a
great
sense
of
delicacy
where
other
persons
feelings
were
concerned
he
once
paid
a
visit
to
george
meredith
the
novelist
when
meredith
was
old
and
weak
meredith
suffered
from
an
unusual
disease
that
caused
him
to
fall
occasionally
the
two
men
were
walking
up
a
path
toward
meredith
summerhouse
conan
doyle
in
the
lead
when
conan
doyle
heard
the
old
novelist
fall
behind
him
he
judged
by
the
sound
which
the
fall
was
a
mere
slip
and
could
not
have
hurt
meredith
therefore
he
did
not
turn
and
he
strode
on
as
if
he
had
heard
nothing
he
was
a
fiercely
proud
old
man
conan
doyle
later
explained
and
my
instincts
told
me
that
his
humiliation
in
being
helped
up
would
be
far
greater
than
any
relief
i
could
give
him
there
is
an
old
japanese
legend
about
a
man
renowned
for
his
flawless
manners
visiting
a
remote
village
wanting
to
honor
as
well
as
observe
him
the
villagers
prepared
a
banquet
as
they
sat
to
eat
all
eyes
were
on
their
noble
guest
everyone
looked
at
a
what
how
the
man
held
his
chopsticks
so
that
they
could
imitate
him
but
then
by
an
unfortunate
accident
as
the
mannered
man
raised
a
slippery
slice
of
tofu
to
his
lips
he
b
placed
was
placed
the
tiniest
bit
of
excess
pressure
on
his
chopsticks
propelling
his
tofu
through
the
air
and
onto
his
neighbor
lap
after
a
brief
moment
of
surprise
in
order
to
preserve
the
myth
of
their
guest
perfection
and
keep
c
him
himself
from
any
embarrassment
all
the
villagers
at
the
banquet
began
to
fling
tofu
into
each
other
laps
the
famous
expression
keep
your
friends
close
but
keep
your
enemies
even
closer
was
exemplified
well
in
nelson
mandela
attempt
to
learn
afrikaans
the
language
of
his
enemy
mandela
first
began
to
learn
the
language
of
the
afrikaners
the
white
south
africans
in
the 
to
the
disapproval
of
his
followers
they
thought
it
was
a
waste
of
time
but
mandela
felt
that
it
was
crucial
for
gaining
insight
into
the
world
view
of
the
afrikaners
by
obtaining
this
perspective
of
how
the
afrikaners
looked
at
the
world
he
would
be
able
to
understand
their
strengths
and
weaknesses
in
many
ways
mandela
greatest
contribution
as
president
of
the
south
africans
including
the
afrikaners
was
the
way
he
chose
to
leave
the
presidency
this
understanding
of
the
afrikaners
proved
to
be
invaluable
later
in
successfully
persuading
them
to
accept
his
people
demands
the
ultimate
power
is
the
power
to
get
people
to
do
as
you
wish
when
you
can
do
this
without
having
to
force
people
or
hurt
them
when
they
willingly
grant
you
what
you
desire
then
your
power
is
untouchable
the
best
way
to
achieve
this
position
is
to
create
a
relationship
of
dependence
the
master
requires
your
services
he
is
weak
or
unable
to
function
without
you
you
have
involved
yourself
in
his
work
so
deeply
that
doing
away
with
you
would
bring
him
great
difficulty
or
at
least
would
mean
valuable
time
lost
in
training
another
to
replace
you
once
such
a
relationship
is
established
you
have
the
upper
hand
to
make
the
master
do
as
you
wish
it
is
the
classic
case
of
the
servant
of
the
king
who
actually
the
king
if
you
were
a
butterfly
would
you
be
attracted
to
a
more
colorful
flower
or
a
less
colorful
one
most
of
you
would
probably
prefer
the
more
colorful
option
the
same
is
TRUE
for
pollinators
such
as
bees
and
butterflies
for
years
biologists
have
known
that
flowers
use
striking
colors
scents
elaborately
shaped
petals
and
nectar
to
attract
pollinators
recent
studies
however
reveal
another
powerful
tool
of
attraction
used
by
flowers
scientists
have
discovered
that
mobile
flowers
are
visited
more
often
by
pollinating
insects
than
their
more
static
counterparts
it
is
almost
as
if
the
flowers
are
waving
to
the
insects
saying
welcome
come
here
and
have
a
drink
along
with
this
interesting
finding
scientists
have
also
concluded
that
due
to
their
greater
range
of
motion
flowers
with
long
thin
stalks
attract
more
insects
a
brilliant
friend
of
mine
once
told
me
when
you
suddenly
see
a
problem
something
happens
that
you
have
the
answer
before
you
are
able
to
put
it
into
words
it
is
all
done
subconsciously
this
has
happened
many
times
to
me
this
feeling
of
knowing
is
common
the
french
philosopher
and
mathematician
blaise
pascal
is
famous
for
saying
the
heart
has
its
reasons
that
reason
cannot
know
the
great
nineteenth
century
mathematician
carl
friedrich
gauss
also
admitted
that
intuition
often
led
him
to
ideas
he
could
not
immediately
prove
he
said
i
have
had
my
results
for
a
long
time
but
i
do
not
yet
know
how
i
am
to
arrive
at
them
fittingly
so
sometimes
TRUE
genius
simply
cannot
be
put
into
words
researchers
have
come
to
understand
how
the
african
village
weaverbird
prevents
itself
from
being
taken
advantage
of
by
cuckoos
it
is
all
down
to
the
speckles
on
the
eggs
david
lahti
and
his
colleagues
have
described
how
village
weaverbirds
lay
eggs
which
all
show
a
very
similar
pattern
of
speckles
suggesting
that
if
a
cuckoo
laid
an
egg
in
the
nest
the
weaverbird
will
be
able
to
spot
the
foreign
egg
almost
immediately
but
when
the
researchers
studied
two
colonies
of
the
birds
that
had
been
introduced
more
than
years
ago
to
two
islands
without
any
cuckoos
they
found
that
those
birds
eggs
no
longer
exhibited
the
same
speckle
patterns
in
a
neat
demonstration
of
the
power
of
evolution
these
results
show
how
in
the
absence
of
pressure
from
parasitic
cuckoos
the
appearance
of
the
eggs
has
altered
because
why
don
we
think
differently
more
often
the
reason
is
that
we
do
not
need
to
be
creative
for
most
of
what
we
do
for
example
we
do
not
need
to
be
creative
when
we
are
driving
on
the
freeway
or
riding
in
an
elevator
or
waiting
in
line
at
a
grocery
store
when
it
comes
to
the
business
of
living
for
most
of
our
activities
these
routines
are
indispensable
without
them
our
lives
would
be
in
chaos
and
we
would
not
get
much
accomplished
if
you
got
up
this
morning
and
started
contemplating
the
shape
of
your
toothbrush
or
questioning
the
meaning
of
toast
you
probably
would
not
make
it
to
work
in
chinese
food
the
idea
is
that
it
should
be
boiling
hot
because
that
is
crucial
to
its
flavor
embodied
in
the
phrase
wok
hei
which
means
the
breath
or
essence
of
the
combination
of
tastes
added
by
a
hot
wok
in
belgian
researchers
at
leuven
university
confirmed
just
how
the
link
between
temperature
and
taste
works
they
identified
microscopic
channels
in
our
taste
buds
which
seem
to
respond
differently
at
different
temperatures
apparently
the
higher
the
temperature
the
more
intense
the
flavor
this
is
why
which
is
why
ice
cream
makers
add
stacks
of
sugar
as
you
can
tell
all
too
clearly
when
ice
cream
melts
in
a
similar
way
some
bitter
tastes
like
tea
taste
better
when
hot
because
they
are
more
intense
ice
cream
tastes
better
when
tea
flavors
are
added
ice
cream
does
not
taste
that
sweet
straight
from
the
fridge
they
serve
ice
cream
for
dessert
in
chinese
restaurants
it
is
not
recommended
to
eat
ice
cream
while
drinking
hot
tea
ice
cream
tastes
sweeter
especially
in
the
winter
time
unlike
the
novel
short
story
or
play
film
is
not
handy
to
study
it
cannot
be
effectively
frozen
on
the
printed
page
the
novel
and
short
story
are
relatively
easy
to
study
because
they
are
written
to
be
read
the
stage
play
is
slightly
more
difficult
to
study
because
it
is
written
to
be
performed
but
plays
are
printed
and
because
they
rely
heavily
on
the
spoken
word
imaginative
readers
can
create
at
least
a
pale
imitation
of
the
experience
they
might
have
watching
a
performance
on
stage
this
cannot
be
said
of
the
screenplay
for
a
film
depends
greatly
on
visual
and
other
nonverbal
elements
that
are
not
easily
expressed
in
writing
the
screenplay
requires
so
much
filling
in
by
our
imagination
that
we
cannot
really
approximate
the
experience
of
a
film
by
reading
a
screenplay
and
reading
a
screenplay
is
worthwhile
only
if
we
have
already
seen
the
film
thus
most
screenplays
rely
more
on
the
spoken
word
than
stage
play
attract
a
much
wider
readership
than
short
stories
do
share
many
elements
with
other
literary
genres
are
popular
though
it
requires
extra
effort
to
study
them

published
not
to
be
read
but
rather
to
be
remembered
every
writer
is
starting
from
a
different
point
and
is
bound
for
a
different
destination
yet
many
writers
are
paralyzed
by
the
thought
that
they
are
competing
with
everybody
else
who
is
trying
to
write
and
presumably
doing
it
better
this
can
often
happen
in
a
writing
class
inexperienced
students
are
chilled
to
find
themselves
in
the
same
class
with
students
whose
articles
have
appeared
in
the
college
newspaper
but
writing
for
the
college
paper
is
no
great
credit
i
have
often
found
that
the
hares
who
write
for
the
paper
are
overtaken
by
the
tortoises
who
move
studiously
toward
the
goal
of
mastering
the
craft
the
same
fear
hangs
around
freelance
writers
who
see
the
work
of
other
writers
appearing
in
magazines
while
their
own
keeps
returning
in
the
mail
forget
the
competition
and
go
at
your
own
pace
the
traditional
american
view
was
that
fences
were
out
of
place
in
the
american
landscape
this
notion
turned
up
repeatedly
in
nineteenth
century
american
writing
about
the
landscape
one
author
after
another
severely
criticized
the
englishman
insultingly
inhospitable
brick

with
broken

frank
j
scott
an
early
landscape
architect
who
had
a
large
impact
on
the
look
of
america
first
suburbs
worked
tirelessly
to
rid
the
landscape
of
fences
writing
in
he
held
that
to
narrow
our
neighbors
views
of
the
free
graces
of
nature
was
unselfish
and
undemocratic
to
drive
through
virtually
any
american
suburb
today
where
every
lawn
steps
right
up
to
the
street
in
a
gesture
of
openness
and
welcoming
is
to
see
how
completely
such
views
have
triumphed
a
case
of
the
negative
impact
of
an
innovation
was
reported
by
a
researcher
examining
the
spread
of
the
snowmobile
among
the
skolt
lapps
in
northern
finland
the
snowmobile
offered
considerable
relative
advantages
to
the
lapps
who
used
reindeer
sleds
as
their
primary
means
of
transportation
it
was
much
faster
making
trips
for
supplies
more
efficient
however
the
snowmobile
had
a
beneficial
disastrous
effects
on
the
lapps
first
the
noise
of
the
snowmobile
frightened
the
reindeer
who
in
turn
exhibited
health
problems
and
produced
fewer
calves
each
year
herd
sizes
were
b
reduced
increased
further
by
herders
who
sold
some
of
their
reindeer
to
buy
a
snowmobile
with
smaller
herds
the
lapps
found
it
more
difficult
to
survive
and
the
snowmobile
was
eventually
viewed
as
a
product
that
drove
the
lapps
into
c
poverty
wealth
one
of
the
most
potentially
productive
trends
in
education
today
is
the
focus
on
interdisciplinary
studies
teaching
math
as
it
applies
to
science
for
example
or
relating
the
various
humanities
this
applies
to
art
education
too
if
we
trivialize
art
and
remove
it
from
the
core
of
a
mainstream
education
we
not
only
deny
our
students
full
access
to
one
of
humankind
most
profound
experiences
but
we
miss
countless
opportunities
to
improve
their
grasp
of
other
subjects
as
well
moreover
we
deny
students
access
to
an
extremely
useful
kind
of
training
and
a
productive
mode
of
thought
we
should
also
consider
that
the
more
legitimately
we
weave
art
into
the
fabric
of
the
general
curriculum
the
better
our
students
will
understand
the
important
role
art
plays
in
culture
the
graph
above
shows
the
percentage
of

growth
and
forest

in
the
continents
of
the
world
since
africa
shows
the
highest
percentage
of
population
growth
whereas
europe
shows
the
lowest
percentage
of
population
growth
africa
also
shows
the
highest
percentage
of
forest
loss
followed
by
latin
america
oceania
asia
and
north
america
the
only
continent
that
exhibits
a
negative
percentage
in

which
translates
to
forest

is
europe
a
point
of
note
is
that
while
asia
and
oceania
have
similar
percentages
of
population
growth
oceania
displays
less
forest

than
asia
overall
there
are

with

and

jaisalmer
is
straight
out
of
the
arabian
nights
so
little
has
the
way
of
life
altered
here
that
it
is
easy
to
imagine
yourself
back
in
the
th
century
it
is
the
only
fortress
city
in
india
still
functioning
with
one
quarter
of
its
population
living
within
the
walls
it
is
just
far
enough
off
the
beaten
path
to
have
been
spared
damage
from

the

wealth
originally
came
from
the
substantial
tolls
it
placed
on
passing
merchants
the
best
known
female
artist
of
the
sixteenth
century
sofonisba
anguissola
was
born
into
a
noble
italian
family
her
mother
died
young
leaving
her
wealthy
husband
with
five
talented
daughters
unusual
of
the
time
this
liberal
father
gave
his
daughters
a
full
classical
education
including
painting
it
was
this
enlightened
attitude
that
enabled
anguissola
to
earn
her
own
living
as
a
portrait
painter
in
the
spanish
court
and
helped
her
to
rise
above
the
restrictions
of
her
class
and
gender
in
three
sisters
playing
chess
anguissola
broke
with
tradition
by
concentrating
on
those
scenes
and
models
available
to
her
painting
her
sisters
in
a
domestic
setting
this
gave
the
portrait
an
immediacy
which
allowed
the
contemporary
italian
art
historian
vasari
to
attribute
to
her
the
development
of
the
conversational
portrait
as
opposed
to
the
formal
frontal
or
profile
portrait
science
of
course
is
an
indispensable
source
of
information
for
the
contemporary
writer
it
is
furthermore
a
necessary
part
of
his
highly
technological
environment
thus
it
is
also
an
inevitable
component
of
his
sensibility
and
a
decisive
even
if
often
unrecognized
component
of
his
creative
imagination
but
science
is
not
in
itself
an
elemental
well
spring
of
literature
even
the
most
refined
and
precise
research
data
are
only
raw
materials
which
may
or
may
not
become
literature
for
whatever
becomes
a
work
of
art
of
any
kind
does
so
as
a
result
of
an
act
of
creation
an
act
of
artistic
composition
an
act
involving
the
art
of
make
believe
scientific
statements
or
remarks
as
such
even
when
they
are
valid
reliable
and
comprehensive
are
not
literature
one
of
the
common
mistakes
that
employers
make
is
looking
at
a
team
of
employees
as
a
homogeneous
group
that
rises
and
falls
together
offering
incentives
such
as
a
group
bonus
or
a
vacation
trip
to
a
team
as
a
whole
is
not
a
smart
managerial
move
because
it
fails
to
acknowledge
who
an
individual
is
for
example
sending
an
entire
team
to
hawaii
for
a
job
well
done
actually
discourages
an
employee
efforts
to
do
his
best
work
he
only
needs
to
perform
well
enough
to
help
achieve
the
team
objective
if
on
the
other
hand
the
employee
knew
that
individual
rewards
were
possible
he
would
be
more
likely
to
strive
to
outperform
expectations
while
teamwork
is
important
within
a
corporation
management
should
come
up
with
new
compensation
packages
to
help
individuals
to
become
champions
fortunately
one
of
the
most
sustained
research
programs
in
post
war
musicology
has
succeeded
in
reconstructing
their
original
sequence
beethoven
took
scraps
of
paper
with
him
on
his
frequent
walks
writing
down
his
musical
ideas
as
they
came
to
him
at
home
he
kept
large
sketchbooks
into
which
he
might
copy
the
results
or
enter
new
ideas
fashioning
and
refashioning
the
music
crossing
it
out
and
starting
again
after
beethoven
death
these
sketchbooks
were
scattered
and
in
many
cases
broken
up
as
a
result
you
can
work
through
them
and
trace
the
painful
process
by
which
beethoven
edged
toward
the
music
that
we
know
for
instance
while
the
first
section
of
the
ode
to
joy
seems
to
have
come
to
him
with
little
difficulty
the
middle
section
gave
him
enormous
trouble
there
is
sketch
upon
sketch
in
which
beethoven
tries
one
idea
then
another
and
you
find
that
the
most
characteristic
and
expressive
features
of
the
music
come
together
only
during
the
final
stages
of
the
compositional
process
many
theatergoers
have
been
offered
lots
of
good
plays
including
west
side
story
the
king
and
i
and
dracula
for
several
decades
however
they
have
hardly
ever
seen
new
works
recently
because
many
producers
have
avoided
making
a
new
play
part
of
the
reason
may
be
the
tremendous
cost
of
making
a
new
production
these
days
it
is
TRUE
that
many
producers
asked
to
invest
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
a
production
have
preferred
a
play
of
proven
merit
and
past
success
to
a
new
untried
play
that
sounds
like
a
reasonable
excuse
but
in
fact
this
practice
can
lead
to
an
undesirable
situation
unless
new
plays
are
given
a
chance
today
there
will
be
nothing
to
revive
in
the
future
if
you
compare
a
walnut
with
some
of
the
beautiful
and
exciting
things
that
grow
on
our
planet
it
does
not
seem
to
be
a
marvelous
creation
it
is
common
rough
not
particularly
attractive
and
certainly
not
of
much
value
besides
it
is
small
its
growth
is
limited
by
the
hard
shell
that
surrounds
it
the
shell
from
which
it
never
escapes
during
its
lifetime
of
course
that
is
the
wrong
way
to
judge
a
walnut
break
one
open
and
look
inside
see
how
the
walnut
has
grown
to
fill
every
corner
available
to
it
it
had
no
say
in
the
size
or
shape
of
that
shell
however
given
those
limitations
it
achieved
its
full
growth
how
lucky
we
will
be
if
like
the
walnut
we
blossom
and
bloom
in
every
aspect
of
the
life
that
is
given
us
take
heart
if
one
nut
can
do
it
so
can
you
jim
performed
fieldwork
in
lesotho
a
small
nation
in
africa
there
studying
and
interacting
with
local
villagers
he
patiently
earned
their
trust
until
one
day
he
was
asked
to
join
in
one
of
their
songs
a
the
villagers
found
his
response
puzzling
they
just
stared
at
jim
and
said
what
do
you
mean
you
don
sing
you
talk
jim
recalls
later
it
was
as
odd
to
them
as
if
i
told
them
that
i
couldn
walk
or
dance
even
though
i
have
both
my
legs
b
jim
replied
in
a
soft
voice
i
don
sing
and
it
was
TRUE
although
he
was
an
excellent
oboe
player
he
was
unable
to
sing
a
simple
melody
c
that
because
singing
and
dancing
were
a
natural
activity
in
their
lives
involving
everyone
their
word
for
singing
ho
bina
also
means
to
dance
there
is
no
distinction
since
it
is
assumed
that
singing
involves
bodily
movement
and
also
in
a
moment
his
heart
responded
thrillingly
to
this
novel
mood
an
instantaneous
and
strong
impulse
moved
him
to
battle
with
his
desperate
fate
he
would
pull
himself
out
of
despair
he
would
make
a
man
of
himself
again
he
would
conquer
the
evil
that
had
taken
possession
of
him
there
was
time
he
was
comparatively
young
yet
he
would
revive
his
old
eager
ambitions
and
pursue
them
without
faltering
those
solemn
but
sweet
organ
notes
had
set
up
a
revolution
in
him
tomorrow
he
would
go
into
the
roaring
downtown
district
and
find
work
a
fur
importer
had
once
offered
him
a
place
as
driver
he
would
find
him
tomorrow
and
ask
for
the
position
he
would
be
somebody
in
the
world
if
someone
were
to
say
life
is
a
cup
of
coffee
it
is
unlikely
that
you
would
have
heard
this
expression
before
but
its
novelty
forces
you
to
think
about
its
meaning
the
vehicle
used
a
cup
of
coffee
is
a
common
object
of
everyday
life
and
therefore
easily
perceivable
as
a
source
for
thinking
about
that
life
the
metaphor
compels
you
to
start
thinking
of
life
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
physical
social
and
other
attributes
that
are
associated
with
a
cup
of
coffee
for
this
metaphor
to
gain
currency
however
it
must
capture
the
fancy
of
many
other
people
for
a
period
of
time
then
and
only
then
will
its
novelty
have
become
worn
out
and
will
it
become
the
basis
for
a
new
conceptual
metaphor
life
is
a
drinking
substance
after
that
expressions
such
as
life
is
a
cup
of
tea
life
is
a
bottle
of
beer
life
is
a
glass
of
milk
will
become
similarly
understandable
as
offering
different
perspectives
on
life
a
new
metaphor
initially
makes
people
a
its
meaning
if
it
loses
its
novelty
later
by
gaining
b
it
will
give
birth
to
similar
types
of
metaphorical
expressions

it

everything
in

keeps
you
company
you
see

progress
every
day
when
she

asked
what
she
would
do
if
she
had
all
the

and
money
in
the

serafina
laughed
and
repeated
the
same
list
of
activities
it
is
not
that
serafina
is
ignorant
of
the
alternatives
offered
by
urban
life
she
watches
television
occasionally
and
reads
newsmagazines
but
their
more
fashionable
and
modern
way
of
life
does
not
attract
serafina
she

the

she
plays
in
the

this
is
used
in
product
manufacturing
this
is
designed
by
determining
the
sequences
of
operations
for
the
manufacturing
of
each
product
component
as
well
as
the
final
product
work
assignments
the
number
of
machines
and
production
rates
are
coordinated
so
that
all
operations
performed
along
this
work
successfully
together
all
movement
of
product
parts
on
this
is
simplified
with
no
crossing
over
backtracking
or
repetition
this
is
increasingly
being
handled
by
computers
which
monitor
information
and
adjust
the
flow
of
parts
accordingly
this
usually
consists
of
conveyor
belts
on
which
workers
perform
specific
functions
nowadays
automatic
machinery
and
industrial
robots
are
taking
the
place
of
human
workers
on
this
for
a
year
danny
had
trained
hard
to
master
the
famous
pikes
peak
marathon
but
when
running
the
actual
marathon
he
was
feeling
weary
and
tired
in
a
narrow
path
through
the
woods
he
got
stuck
behind
a
slow
weak
runner
wearing
a
t
shirt
with
bob 
written
on
the
back
he
felt
even
more
tired
because
he
had
to
lag
behind
the
fellow
as
he
was
finally
overtaking
the
runner
out
of
curiosity
he
asked
him
what
bob
my
friend
bob
had
a
dream
to
run
this
marathon
four
times
he
answered
he
ran
it
three
times
but
then
last
year
he
died
so
i
decided
to
complete
his
dream
for
him
this
is
bob
suddenly
all
the
exhaustion
he
had
been
feeling
during
the
race
disappeared
we
are
addicted
to
our
cars
we
do
not
think
twice
before
driving
to
pick
something
up
at
a
store
that
is
only
three
blocks
away
in
fact
we
romanticize
driving
with
our
thoughts
of
long
sunday
drives
and
adventurous
cross
country
road
trips
well
we
need
to
get
rid
of
this
addiction
and
fast
because
driving
is
harmful
to
our
health
and
to
our
planet
health
the
air
pollutants
that
spit
out
from
the
car
exhaust
pipes
have
been
proven
to
cause
cancer
and
the
carbon
dioxide
that
is
emitted
causes
global
warming
one
of
the
easiest
ways
to
reduce
these
emissions
is
simply
to
change
our
mind
set
about
driving
we
need
to
make
driving
our
last
choice
of
transportation
to
live
a
happy
healthy
life
and
the
first
step
in
achieving
this
new
mind
set
is
to
reorganize
our
lives
so
we
do
not
need
to
drive
much
or
far
no
matter
what
we
are
shopping
for
it
is
not
primarily
a
brand
we
are
choosing
but
a
culture
or
rather
the
people
associated
with
that
culture
a
whatever
whether
you
wear
torn
jeans
or
like
to
recite
poetry
by
doing
so
you
make
a
statement
of
belonging
to
a
group
of
people
who
we
believe
we
are
b
is
are
a
result
of
the
choices
we
make
about
who
we
want
to
be
like
and
we
subsequently
demonstrate
this
desired
likeness
to
others
in
various
and
often
subtle
ways
artificial
as
this
process
is
this
is
what
becomes
our
identity 
an
identity
c
grounded
grounding
on
all
the
superficial
differences
we
distinguish
between
ourselves
and
others
this
after
all
is
what
we
are
shopping
for
self
identity
knowledge
of
who
we
are
almost
every
day
i
play
a
game
with
myself
that
i
call
time
machine 
i
made
it
up
in
response
to
my
erroneous
belief
that
what
i
was
all
worked
up
about
was
really
important
to
play
time
machine
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
imagine
that
whatever
circumstance
you
are
dealing
with
is
not
happening
right
now
but
a
year
from
now
it
might
be
an
argument
with
your
spouse
a
mistake
or
a
lost
opportunity
but
it
is
highly
likely
that
a
year
from
now
you
are
not
going
to
care
it
will
be
one
more
irrelevant
detail
in
your
life
while
this
simple
game
will
not
solve
every
your
problems
it
can
give
you
an
enormous
amount
of
needed
perspective
i
find
myself
laughing
at
things
that
i
used
to
take
far
too
seriously
there
are
some
areas
of
mathematics
where
long
unpleasant
but
basically
routine
calculations
have
to
be
done
and
there
are
some
good
computer
programs
for
doing
them
thus
computers
can
be
very
useful
time
saving
devices
sometimes
so
much
so
that
they
enable
mathematicians
to
discover
results
that
they
could
not
have
discovered
on
their
own
nevertheless
the
kind
of
help
that
computers
can
provide
is
very
limited
one
point
that
deserves
to
be
made
is
that
the
lack
of
women
in
mathematics
is
another
statistical
phenomenon
if
it
happens
that
your
problem
or
more
usually
sub
problem
is
one
of
the
small
minority
that
can
be
solved
by
a
long
and
repetitive
search
then
well
and
good
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
stuck
and
need
a
bright
idea
then
in
the
present
state
of
technology
a
computer
will
be
no
help
whatsoever
furniture
is
among
the
oldest
engineering
structures
designed
to
carry
a
rather
well
defined
load
under
rather
well
defined
circumstances
we
are
not
surprised
that
furniture
used
beyond
its
intended
purpose
is
broken
and
we
readily
blame
the
child
who
abuses
the
furniture
rather
than
the
designer
of
the
furniture
or
the
furniture
itself
when
it
is
abused
thus
a
chair
must
support
a
person
in
a
sitting
position
but
it
might
not
be
expected
to
survive
a
fall
from
a
tall
building
a
child
bed
might
be
expected
to
support
a
sleeping
child
but
it
would
not
necessarily
be
considered
badly
designed
if
it
collapsed
under
the
child
wild
use
of
it
as
a
trampoline
the
arms
and
legs
of
chairs
the
heads
and
feet
of
beds
just
like
those
of
the
people
whom
they
serve
cannot
be
expected
to
be
without
limit
a
vendor
in
a
city
set
up
shop
and
sold
doughnuts
and
coffee
to
passersby
during
the
breakfast
and
lunch
hours
he
always
had
long
lines
of
customers
waiting
he
noticed
that
as
he
was
a
one
man
show
the
biggest
bottleneck
preventing
him
from
selling
more
doughnuts
and
coffee
was
the
disproportionate
amount
of
time
it
took
to
make
change
for
his
customers
finally
he
simply
put
a
small
basket
on
the
side
of
his
stand
filled
with
dollar
bills
and
coins
most
customers
responded
by
being
completely
honest
often
leaving
him
larger
than
normal
tips
also
he
was
able
to
move
customers
through
at
twice
the
pace
because
he
did
not
have
to
make
change
in
addition
he
found
that
his
customers
liked
this
idea
and
kept
coming
back
by
in
this
way
he
was
able
to
double
his
sales
few
things
hold
people
back
more
than
they
do
not
ask
for
what
they
need
because
the
answer
may
be
no
they
do
not
ask
their
boss
for
a
raise
or
for
more
time
off
they
are
afraid
to
be
the
first
to
say
i
love
you
they
do
not
ask
for
help
from
people
they
do
not
know
well
in
short
they
do
not
let
their
wants
and
needs
be
known
because
they
are
afraid
of
being
turned
away
but
the
wonderful
truth
is
this
if
you
can
accept
no
for
an
answer
you
can
fearlessly
ask
for
whatever
you
need
it
is
also
TRUE
that
you
will
not
receive
if
you
do
not
ask
so
do
not
be
afraid
to
ask
you
may
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
people
willing
to
help
take
a
moment
to
cast
your
mind
back
over
the
past
week
or
so
and
think
about
something
you
regret
was
it
something
you
did
or
something
you
failed
to
do
it
seems
that
as
an
example
consider
mary
and
laura
who
invest
their
money
in
companies
a
and
b
mary
invests
in
company
a
and
considers
switching
to
company
b
but
she
decides
not
to
laura
invests
in
company
b
and
considers
switching
to
company
a
and
she
decides
to
do
so
they
both
find
out
that
they
would
have
been
better
off
by
if
they
had
taken
different
actions
who
do
you
think
feels
more
regret
most
people
judge
that
laura
will
regret
her
action
more
than
mary
will
regret
her
inaction
unplanned
actions
always
give
rise
to
regrets
people
regret
their
actions
more
than
their
failures
to
act
people
regret
most
when
their
relationship
with
others
suffers
people
feel
satisfied
when
they
make
their
own
decisions
regret
makes
people
take
more
profitable
actions
the
spread
of
prosperity
the
single
family
home
the
invention
of
television
and
computers
have
all
made
it
possible
for
us
to
live
private
lives
unimaginable
to
previous
generations
we
no
longer
live
in
close
quarters
with
our
neighbors
we
can
move
about
without
crowding
into
buses
or
trains
we
do
not
have
to
go
to
theaters
or
share
our
tastes
with
our
neighbors
however
the
same
technologies
that
help
separate
us
from
the
crowds
also
make
it
possible
to
monitor
and
record
our
behaviors
although
fewer
people
have
intimate
knowledge
of
our
lives
many
people
mostly
unknown
to
us
know
something
about
us
the
very
technology
that
was
supposed
to
free
us
from
mass
society
has
turned
out
to
be
as
much
a
fishbowl
as
an
information
highway
in
modern
society
we
have
discovered
that
people
cannot
use
public
transportation
because
of
crowding
technology
makes
us
independent
from
natural
environments
more
people
become
indifferent
to
the
spread
of
prosperity
cooperating
with
people
leads
to
wrong
conclusions
being
free
often
means
also
being
naked
efficiency
means
producing
a
specific
end
rapidly
with
the
a
least
most
amount
of
cost
the
idea
of
efficiency
is
specific
to
the
interests
of
the
industry
or
business
but
is
typically
advertised
as
a
b
loss
benefit
to
the
customer
examples
are
plentiful
the
salad
bars
filling
your
own
cup
self
service
gasoline
atms
microwave
dinners
and
convenience
stores
which
are
different
from
the
old
time
groceries
where
you
gave
your
order
to
the
grocer
the
interesting
element
here
is
that
the
customer
often
ends
up
doing
the
work
that
previously
was
done
for
them
and
the
customer
ends
up
c
saving
spending
more
time
and
being
forced
to
learn
new
technologies
remember
more
numbers
and
often
pay
higher
prices
in
order
for
the
business
to
operate
more
efficiently
or
maintain
a
higher
profit

the
three
pictures
above
represent
a
model
of
the
effects
of
global
warming
on
permafrost
regions
permafrost
is
frozen
ground
that
remains
at
or
below
for
more
than
two
years
most
of
the
world
permafrost
has
been
frozen
for
millennia
trapping
massive
amounts
of
carbon
in
organic
material
in
areas
of
extreme
cold
presented
in
picture
permafrost
is
thousands
of
feet
thick
and
lies
below
a
layer
of
soil
a
few
feet
deep
called
the
active
layer
which
freezes
and
thaws
with
the
seasons
where
the
average
annual
air
temperature
is
slightly
below
freezing
permafrost
is
scattered
as

by
a
shallower

in
permafrost
regions
that
now
experience
shorter
milder
winters
the
area
of
permafrost
is
reduced
further
compared
to

carbon
dioxide
and
methane
are
freed
into
the
atmosphere
and
more
trees
and
plants
grow
as
in

my
mother
gave
me
some
strawberry
jam
to
take
to
mrs
sampson
it
was
winter
and
when
she
opened
the
door
i
was
overcome
by
the
smell
of
the
stove
and
the
damp
dark
atmosphere
i
was
afraid
of
mrs
sampson
she
was
a
big
woman
with
gray
skin
like
clay
with
a
couple
of
gray
hairs
sticking
out
of
her
chin
she
always
wore
a
dirty
mud
colored
cardigan
over
shapeless
dresses
worst
of
all
she
had
bad
breath
here
you
are
dear
she
said
in
her
scratchy
voice
and
put
a
dollar
bill
in
my
hand
but
don
spend
it
all
at
once
i
fled
back
to
the
relative
safety
of
my
own
home
american
culture
in
general
appears
suspicious
of
leisure
some
people
believe
this
may
be
due
to
the
protestant
work
ethic
many
americans
fill
their
free
time
with
intellectually
or
physically
demanding
hobbies
or
volunteer
work
even
on
vacation
americans
stay
in
touch
with
the
workplace
via
their
cellular
phones
and
laptop
computers
a
europeans
hold
leisure
in
high
regard
a
new
french
law
gave
france
the
shortest
work
week
in
europe
companies
with
more
than
twenty
employees
are
required
to
cut
work
hours
from
to
per
week
besides
creating
more
leisure
time
for
workers
this
move
is
expected
to
help
ease
unemployment
in
germany
b
longer
work
weeks
may
soon
be
the
standard
its
low
birth
rate
has
resulted
in
fewer
workers
supporting
more
and
more
retired
germans
in
the

welfare
system
growing
native
plants
in
a
garden
is
catching
on
like
wildfire
natives
often
attract
more
birds
and
pollinators
such
as
bees
and
butterflies
increasing
their
diversity
to
your
garden
imitating
a
native
landscape
in
an
isolated
urban
yard
however
does
not
do
all
that
much
to
make
up
for
lost
native
habitat
so
what
is
the
most
ecological
use
of
your
garden
at
the
top
of
the
list
is
gardening
for
your
own
food
there
is
no
reason
that
what
you
plant
for
birds
butterflies
and
bees
cannot
also
feed
you
and
your
family
sunflowers
are
often
called
nature
bird
feeders 
but
you
can
plant
enough
to
share
the
oil
rich
seeds
many
fruit
trees
in
your
garden
can
also
feed
both
birds
and
you
uses
of
native
plants
in
the
wild
as
food
suppliers
necessities
of
preserving
the
native
landscapes
increasing

and

ecological
distinction
between
birds
and
pollinators
a
conditioning
occurs
indirectly
which
adds
to
its
impact
on
us
let
say
for
example
that
you
watch
another
person
get
an
electric
shock
each
time
a
signal
light
comes
on
before
the
shock
is
delivered
even
if
you
do
not
receive
a
shock
yourself
you
will
soon
develop
an
emotional
response
to
the
light
children
who
learn
to
fear
thunder
by
watching
their
parents
react
to
it
have
undergone
similar
conditioning
if
horror
movies
can
affect
us
we
might
expect
the
emotions
of
parents
friends
and
relatives
to
have
even
more
impact
how
for
instance
does
a
city
child
learn
to
fear
snakes
and
respond
emotionally
to
mere
pictures
of
them
being
told
that
snakes
are
dangerous
may
not
explain
the
child
emotional
response
more
likely
the
child
has
observed
others
reacting
fearfully
to
the
word
snake

the
barrier
at
the
river
scheldt
in
the
netherlands
is
the
world
largest
tidal
surge
barrier
it
protects
zeeland
from
the
constant
threat
of
flooding
completed
in
it
forms
part
of
the
delta
project
a
line
of
massive
sea
defenses
which
was
constructed
after
disastrous
floods
in
as
originally
planned
the
barrier
was
to
be
a
solid
dam
that
by
drastically
restricting
tidal
flows
would
have
destroyed
much
of
the
marine
environment
on
the
eastern
scheldt
in
however
a
campaign
forced
the
project
to
be
suspended
the
project
was
revived
four
years
later
in
a
new
and
greatly
modified
form
instead
of
being
permanently
sealed
the
redesigned
barrier
is
now
normally
open
to
the
tides
restricting
their
flow
by
only
percent
it
is

the
young
of
precocial
birds
belonging
to
the
same
clutch
have
a
strong
incentive
to
hatch
as
close
together
in
time
as
possible
the
mother
and
the
first
hatched
young
will
be
on
the
move
within
hours
chicks
left
behind
in
the
eggs
will
die
when
the
eggs
of
these
species
are
incubated
separately
the
hatching
times
are
spread
over
a
period
of
days
but
when
they
are
kept
together
hatching
times
are
close
by
within
one
or
two
hours
this
coordinated
hatching
is
achieved
by
sound
signals
exchanged
by
the
chicks
while
they
are
still
in
the
eggs
the
most
characteristic
sound
is
a
regular
loud
click
which
is
most
persistent
just
prior
to
hatching
it
is
not
caused
by
a
tapping
against
the
shell
but
is
a
vocalization
associated
with
breathing
movements
we
know
where
we
are
headed
and
what
we
want
to
do
however
quite
often
due
to
forces
outside
our
control
things
do
not
go
as
we
had
planned
and
we
have
to
adjust
to
a
postponement
or
create
a
whole
new
set
of
circumstances
this
is
what
happens
when
life
throws
us
a
curveball
the
fact
is
that
life
is
unpredictable
for
example
your
car
breaks
down
and
you
are
late
for
an
appointment
while
it
is
TRUE
that
you
never
arrive
at
that
important
meeting
you
end
up
spending
a
few
relaxing
hours
with
people
you
would
never
have
met
otherwise
remember
that
not
only
are
curveballs
the
universe
way
of
keeping
us
awake
which
is
a
gift
in
and
of
itself
but
they
are
also
its
method
of
bringing
us
wonderful
surprises
a
when
my
son
was
seven
years
old
we
went
to
a
dolphin
show
after
the
show
i
went
up
to
the
trainer
and
asked
how
did
you
get
the
dolphin
to
do
all
these
really
neat
things
the
trainer
looked
at
my
son
and
me
and
said
unlike
many
parents
whenever
the
dolphin
does
anything
like
what
i
want
him
to
do
i
notice
him
i
give
him
a
hug
and
a
fish
the
light
went
on
in
my
head
whenever
my
son
did
what
i
wanted
him
to
do
i
paid
little
attention
to
him
however
when
he
did
not
i
gave
him
a
lot
of
attention
because
i
did
not
want
to
raise
a
bad
kid
i
was
unintentionally
teaching
him
to
be
a
little
monster
in
order
to
get
my
attention
since
that
day
i
have
tried
hard
to
notice
my
son
good
acts
and
downplay
his
mistakes
a
man
was
diagnosed
with
a
terminal
illness
and
given
six
months
to
live
in
his
last
few
days
he
said
that
he
had
done
more
in
the
past
months
than
in
his
entire
life
remember
that
life
has
a
deadline
we
just
do
not
know
when
it
is
so
let
get
one
a
this
decreasing
number
is
a
constant
reminder
to
motivate
you
to
take
action
to
live
your
life
today
you
trade
each
day
of
your
life
for
what
you
do
in
that
day
make
a
good
trade
b
what
you
have
is
the
number
of
days
that
you
have
left
to
live
write
this
number
down
and
every
morning
cross
it
out
and
write
the
new
number
which
is
one
day
less
c
we
are
going
to
do
some
calculations
to
find
out
how
much
longer
you
have
to
live
start
with
the
number
the
average
life
expectancy
now
subtract
your
current
age
multiply
that
number
by
the
person
who
wrote
of
a
building
bringing
gladness
to
the
viewer
reminds
us
of
the
importance
of
beauty
in
human
life
biologists
account
for
the
human
desire
for
art
in
other
terms
they
explain
that
human
beings
have
very
large
brains
that
demand
stimulation
curious
active
and
inventive
we
humans
constantly
explore
and
in
so
doing
invent
things
that
appeal
to
our
senses
fine
arts
fine
food
fine
scents
and
fine
music
art
has
mostly
been
considered
in
terms
of
seeking
beauty
but
there
are
other
reasons
deeply
rooted
in
the
human
experience
that
create
needs
for
art
for
one
humans
also
reflect
on
the
nature
of
things
and
the
meaning
of
life
visually
and
verbally
we
constantly
communicate
with
each
other
in
our
need
to
understand
and
our
need
to
communicate
the
arts
serve
a
vital
function
it
is
possible
to
observe
a
basic
and
sometimes
unexplainable
division
in
the
animal
world
some
species
crowd
together
and
require
physical
contact
with
each
other
others
avoid
touching
no
apparent
logic
governs
the
category
into
which
a
species
falls
curiously
enough
closely
related
animals
may
belong
to
different
categories
the
great
emperor
penguin
is
a
contact
species
it
conserves
heat
through
contact
with
its
fellows
in
large
groups
the
smaller
adelie
penguin
is
a
non
contact
species
thus
it
is
somewhat
less
adaptable
to
cold
than
the
emperor
other
functions
served
by
contact
behavior
are
unknown
one
could
guess
that
since
contact
animals
are
more
involved
with
each
other
their
social
organization
and
possibly
their
manner
of
exploiting
the
environment
might
be
different
from
those
of
non
contact
animals
dangers
caused
by
cold
to
some
animal
species
conflicts
between
contact
and
non
contact
species
relationship
between
temperature
and
animal
survival
reproduction
patterns
of
different
animal
species
categorization
of
animals
by
their
contact
behaviors
but
the
strong
pig
can
race
to
the
dispenser
and
push
the
weak
pig
aside
to
claim
the
leftovers
consider
the
following
experiment
with
a
strong
and
a
weak
pig
two
pigs
are
kept
in
a
box
with
a
lever
at
one
end
and
a
food
dispenser
at
the
other
when
the
lever
is
pushed
food
appears
at
the
dispenser
if
the
weak
pig
pushes
the
lever
the
strong
pig
waits
by
the
dispenser
and
eats
all
the
food
even
if
the
weak
pig
races
to
the
dispenser
before
the
food
is
gone
the
strong
pig
pushes
the
weak
pig
away
the
weak
pig
realizes
this
so
it
never
pushes
the
lever
first
on
the
other
hand
if
the
strong
pig
pushes
the
lever
the
weak
pig
waits
by
the
dispenser
and
eats
most
of
the
food
this
makes
it
worthwhile
for
the
strong
pig
to
push
the
lever
the
outcome
is
that
the
strong
pig
does
all
the
work
and
the
weak
pig
does
most
of
the
eating
the
face
of
the
water
in
time
became
a
wonderful
book
a
book
that
was
a
dead
language
to
the
uneducated
passenger
but
which
told
its
mind
to
the
pilot
without
reserve
delivering
its
most
cherished
secrets
as
clearly
as
if
it
spoke
them
with
a
voice
the
passenger
who
could
not
read
this
book
saw
nothing
but
all
manner
of
pretty
pictures
in
it
painted
by
the
sun
and
shaded
by
the
clouds
to
the
pilot
however
it
was
a
highlighted
passage
indeed
it
was
more
than
that
for
it
meant
that
a
wreck
or
a
rock
was
buried
there
that
could
tear
the
life
out
of
the
strongest
vessel
that
ever
floated
it
is
the
faintest
and
simplest
expression
the
water
ever
makes
and
the
most
frightening
to
a
pilot
eye
as
we
explore
together
the
virtual
world
that
floats
on
the
edge
of
this
material
life
the
many
imaginative
territories
you
inhabit
bring
back
another
reality
i
catch
images
of
my
own
childhood
wanderings
through
narnia
the
land
of
hobbits
and
mowgli
jungle
all
these
are
deep
pleasures
which
combine
all
my
senses
and
momentarily
transport
me
into
another
dimension
of
living
if
i
were
to
bring
it
all
together
i
would
say
that
among
all
the
misery
fear
injustice
and
pain
i
hope
you
will
not
forget
moments
when
all
this
fades
away
into
periods
of
innocent
joy
it
is
when
we
bring
all
our
powerful
senses
together
perhaps
in
a
moment
in
the
garden
of
earthly
delights
that
we
over
despair
so
the
moment
when
you
dance
to
handel
or
when
you
sit
in
a
pool
of
wild
flowers
or
gravely
take
part
in
your
first
tea
ceremony
these
are
the
moments
you
will
treasure
they
are
with
similar
moments
with
friends
and
loved
ones
what
makes
being
human
bearable
as
we
explore
together
the

what
makes

bearable
a
a
a
cup
of
coffee
this
started
as
early
as
b
c
during
the
new
stone
age
as
people
began
to
settle
into
fixed
agricultural
communities
this
intensified
originally
raised
mainly
for
their
meat
sheep
and
goats
became
valuable
also
for
their
milk
and
wool
cattle
were
domesticated
both
for
meat
and
skin
and
as
work
animals
for
agriculture
their
milk
production
was
not
a
factor
until
much
later
in
history
when
breeding
for
high
milk
production
produced
suitable
cows
horses
were
also
domesticated
and
became
important
for
transportation
and
came
to
play
a
major
part
in
warfare
a
woman
stopped
at
a
flower
shop
to
order
some
flowers
to
be
wired
to
her
mother
who
lived
miles
away
as
she
got
out
of
her
car
she
noticed
a
girl
sitting
on
the
street
sobbing
the
woman
asked
the
girl
what
was
wrong
and
she
replied
i
wanted
to
buy
a
red
rose
for
my
mother
but
i
only
have
cents
and
a
rose
costs
two
dollars
she
smiled
and
said
come
on
in
with
me
i
buy
you
a
rose
for
your
mother
she
placed
her
order
of
flowers
to
her
mother
and
bought
a
rose
for
the
girl
as
they
were
leaving
she
offered
the
girl
a
ride
she
responded
yes
please
if
you
could
take
me
to
my
mother
the
little
girl
directed
her
to
a
grave
and
placed
the
rose
on
it
this
changed
the
woman
plan
she
returned
to
the
flower
shop
canceled
the
wire
order
picked
up
a
bouquet
of
fresh
roses
and
drove
miles
to
meet
her
mother
mr
brown
wanted
his
students
to
learn
math
in
the
context
of
real
life
he
felt
it
was
not
enough
for
them
just
to
work
out
problems
from
a
book
to
show
his
students
how
math
could
really
help
them
he
held
several
contests
during
the
year
the
contests
allowed
his
students
to
have
fun
while
they
practiced
math
and
raised
money
once
he
filled
a
fishbowl
with
marbles
asked
the
students
to
guess
how
many
marbles
there
were
and
awarded
a
free
lunch
to
the
winner
another
time
they
entered
a
contest
to
guess
how
many
soda
cans
the
back
of
a
pickup
truck
was
held
to
win
they
had
to
practice
their
skills
at
estimating
multiplying
dividing
and
measuring
they
used
most
of
the
prize
money
for
an
end
of
the
year
field
trip
it
is
hard
for
street
trees
to
survive
with
only
foot
square
holes
in
the
pavement
the
average
life
of
a
street
tree
surrounded
by
concrete
and
asphalt
a
is
are
seven
to
fifteen
years
many
factors
underground
determine
if
a
street
tree
will
make
it
if
the
soil
is
so
dense
that
the
roots
cannot
get
in
it
will
surely
die
if
they
can
get
in
there
is
a
better
chance
of
getting
the
water
and
nutrients
b
needing
needed
to
survive
another
question
is
whether
adequate
water
supplies
are
getting
into
the
growing
area
some
of
the
water
comes
from
underground
sources
and
some
from
rain
and
it
is
hard
to
measure
c
where
what
the
tree
is
getting
it
of
course
if
the
roots
get
into
the
sewers
they
can
get
everything
they
need
if
you
lead
a
busy
life
and
are
short
of
time
you
may
find
that
you
are
eating
a
full
meal
only
about
once
a
day
from
the
standpoint
of
health
this
is
a
bad
practice
you
would
be
treating
your
body
with
more
consideration
if
you
had
several
small
meals
instead
of
a
single
big
one
a
given
amount
of
food
is
used
more
efficiently
by
the
body
if
it
is
spaced
throughout
the
day
rather
than
eaten
at
one
sitting
such
symptoms
are
likely
to
occur
in
people
who
drink
more
than
five
cups
of
strong
black
coffee
in
a
single
day
people
who
have
large
infrequent
meals
tend
to
gain
more
weight
and
to
have
a
higher
level
of
fat
in
the
blood
than
do
those
who
eat
smaller
quantities
but
the
same
total
at
regular
intervals
we
push
down
our
feelings
because
most
of
us
have
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
there
are
feelings
which
are
unacceptable
some
of
us
learned
that
all
emotions
are
unacceptable
while
others
learned
that
specific
emotions
such
as
anger
or
crying
are
unacceptable
in
fact
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
with
any
kind
of
feeling
when
someone
tells
you
not
to
feel
sad
or
angry
he
or
she
is
asking
the
impossible
you
can
deny
the
feelings
you
are
having
but
you
cannot
stop
them
from
coming
all
that
feelings
need
in
order
to
pass
is
to
be
acknowledged
and
accepted
just
saying
to
yourself
or
someone
else
i
feel
angry
or
sad
or
frightened
is
a
great
start
let
yourself
the
feelings
good
or
bad
human
beings
direct
their
activities
toward
the
satisfaction
of
physical
wants
and
general
well
being
they
avoid
whenever
possible
situations
that
may
bring
about
physical
deprivation
including
pain
hunger
and
a
need
for
sleep
much
contemporary
advertising
promises
these
satisfactions
whether
from
headache
remedies
fancy
foods
or
form
fitting
mattresses
an
individual
can
suffer
any
of
these
deprivations
temporarily
however
and
he
may
knowingly
enter
into
situations
which
will
deprive
him
for
a
time
if
he
believes
that
there
will
be
the
willingness
of
astronauts
to
undergo
periods
of
intense
training
is
at
least
partially
explainable
in
terms
of
the
great
rest
that
they
know
will
come
at
the
end
of
their
missions
no
matter
how
we
shake
or
tap
the
bottle
of
ketchup
some
of
it
refuses
to
come
out
in
some
cases
up
to
percent
of
the
product
is
left
in
the
packaging
when
it
is
thrown
out
this
is
not
only
annoying
for
consumers
but
also
poses
difficulties
when
recycling
the
leftovers
first
have
to
be
removed
from
the
packaging
which
is
expensive
time
consuming

a
german
project
by
the
fraunhofer
institutes
together
with
munich
university
of
technology
and
various
industrial
partners
will
put
an
end
to
this
dilemma
researchers
are
applying
thin
films
no
more
than
nanometers
thick
to
the
inside
surface
of
packaging
in
order
to
when
we
have
made
an
error
as
for
example
in
adding
up
a
column
of
figures
we
have
a
tendency
to
repeat
it
again
and
again
this
phenomenon
is
known
as
the
persistent
error
the
same
thing
happens
when
we
try
to
solve
a
problem
each
time
our
thoughts
take
a
certain
course
that
course
is
more
likely
to
be
followed
the
next
time
the
reason
that
we
keep
making
the
same
error
repeatedly
is
that
associations
form
between
the
ideas
in
the
chain
of
thoughts
and
become
firmer
each
time
they
are
used
until
finally
the
connections
are
so
well
established
that
thus
once
we
have
adopted
an
unprofitable
line
of
thought
it
is
harder
to
adopt
a
profitable
line
about
three
percent
of
the
weight
of
sea
water
is
accounted
for
by
salt
the
salt
content
of
the
ocean
is
being
continually
added
to
by
runoff
from
the
land
but
it
is
not
increasing
yet
salt
cannot
leave
the
sea
by
evaporation
because
the
water
vapor
leaves
it
behind
so
for
many
years
it
was
a
mystery
as
to
why
the
sea
should
given
the
rate
of
runoff
and
particularly
if
the
world
was
supposed
to
be
hundreds
of
millions
of
years
old
the
riddle
was
not
solved
until
the
s
when
the
deep
ocean
openings
were
discovered
sea
water
is
swallowed
up
by
these
cracks
in
the
ocean
bed
when
it
reemerges
millions
of
years
later
as
steam
from
volcanoes
the
salt
has
been
filtered
out
of
it
on
its
passage
through
the
rocks
a
blind
spot
is
not
the
same
as
a
simple
lack
of
knowledge
a
blind
spot
emerges
from
a
a
resistance
connection
to
learning
in
a
particular
area
at
the
root
of
many
of
our
blind
spots
are
a
number
of
emotions
or
attitudes
fear
being
the
most
obvious
but
also
pride
self
satisfaction
and
anxiety
a
manager
for
example
might
have
unsurpassed
knowledge
in
the
financial
field
but
her
understanding
of
people
management
might
be
b
flooded
limited
her
people
find
her
cold
and
aloof
and
want
her
to
become
more
consultative
and
involved
with
the
team
she
however
is
not
willing
to
accept
feedback
about
her
management
style
and
refuses
to
even
consider
the
c
prospect
retrospect
of
changing
her
management
style
i
start
my
long
journey
with
great
enthusiasm
the
thought
of
conquering
the

stirs
me
with
anticipation
although
the
freezing

pounds
upon
me
i
feel
flushed
with
warmth
just
after
ten
o clock
in
the
morning
i
finally
put
my

on

my

races
as
i
take
in

glorious

the

is
deep
blue
and
cloudless
for
fifteen
minutes
i
cherish
the
view
as

i
do
not

the

above
shows
the
equipment
for
downhill
and
cross

skiing
and
their
recommended
sizes
as
you
can
see
the
downhill
ski
is
shorter
and
wider
than
the
cross
country
ski
and
is
about
the
height
of
the
skier
the
cross
country
ski
meets
the
elbow
when
the
arm
is
held
above
the
head
in
either
case
a
slightly
heavier
or
more
experienced
skier
might
want
a
longer
ski
and
a
lighter
or
beginning
skier
might
prefer
a
shorter
ski
the
cross
country
pole
is
longer
than
the
one
for
downhill
skiing
and
its
tip
is
bent
the
length
of
the
cross
country
pole
reaches
the
armpit
the
downhill
pole
fits
comfortably
in
the
hand
about
two
inches
below
the
armpit
the
bottom
of
the

attaches
completely
to

early
photography
continued
the
trend
toward
the
imprisonment
of
the
subject
and
the
object
of
representation
during
photography
first
decades
exposure
times
were
quite
long
a
the
daguerreotype
process
required
exposures
of
four
to
seven
minutes
in
the
sun
and
from
twelve
to
sixty
minutes
indoors
early
photographs
represented
the
world
as
stable
eternal
and
unshakable
and
when
photography
ventured
to
represent
living
things
they
had
to
be
immobilized
b
portrait
studios
universally
employed
various
holding
devices
to
assure
the
steadiness
of
the
sitter
throughout
the
lengthy
time
of
exposure
the
devices
firmly
held
the
person
in
place
in
other
words
a
person
who
wanted
to
see
his
own
image
became
a
voluntary
prisoner
of
the
machine
sometimes
all
a
good
cheese
needs
to
stop
it
from
going
bad
is
a
sympathetic
ear
researchers
in
france
have
come
up
with
an
ultrasonic
sensor
that
will
listen
to
cheese
as
it
matures
and
warn
cheese
makers
of
defects
cheese
makers
have
to
downgrade
up
to
one
fifth
of
their
produce
because
of
undetected
faults
if
the
new
device
works
well
that
problem
could
be
reduced
the
technique
involves
sending
a
low
frequency
ultrasonic
signal
through
the
cheese
to
a
sensor
at
the
other
side
by
measuring
the
change
in
the
speed
and
size
of
the
emerging
signal
the
moisture
and
porosity
of
the
cheese
can
be
mapped
nobody
likes
performance
reviews
employees
are
nervous
they
will
hear
nothing
but
criticism
and
bosses
are
nervous
their
direct
reports
will
respond
defensively
so
people
generally
keep
their
mouths
shut
that
is
unfortunate
because
most
employees
need
help
figuring
out
how
to
improve
their
performance
and
advance
their
careers
also
it
can
be
harmful
to
the
company
if
a
lack
of
clear
feedback
leads
to
undesirable
work
behaviors
there
is
a
way
to
avoid
this
problem
managers
can
help
employees
learn
adaptive
techniques
like
acknowledging
negative
emotions
and
reframing
fears
and
criticisms
constructively
to
prevent
destructive
responses
once
people
are
comfortable
asking
for
feedback
they
will
begin
to
see
how
they
are
doing
relative
to
management
priorities
and
their
work
will
be
more
in
line
with
organizational

composers
describe

requires
not

certain

no

what
style

music
you
write
you
need
to
understand

need
to

of

the

you
need

a

costa

means
rich
coast
in

it
was
discovered
in
and
named
by
christopher
columbus
who
thought
it
might
be
a
land
rich
with
gold
however
costa
rica
has
no
great
mineral
wealth
it
has
instead
rich
soil
and
a
moderate
climate
while
other
latin
american
nations
suffered
exploitation
from
outside
the
region
and
developed
societies
split
by
class
conflict
between
rich
and
poor
costa
rica
developed
an
agricultural
economy
made
up
of
numerous
small
farmers
there
was
not
great
wealth
but
what
there
was
was
spread
evenly
costa
rica
continued
its
unusual
development
after
it
separated
from
spain
in
becoming
the
first
latin
american
country
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
little

held
the
first

in
latin

in
the
early
s
jill
norris
the
mother
of
two
sons
with
learning
difficulties
began
to
exchange
appropriate
toys
with
other
families
out
of
this
she
founded
the
toy
libraries
association
tla
the
association
opened
toy
libraries
in
community
centers
clinics
schools
public
libraries
and
hospitals
around
the
world
from
these
toy
libraries
parents
and
children
could
borrow
toys
knowing
that
they
have
been
thoroughly
tried
and
tested
not
only
for
their
play
value
but
also
for
safety
over
the
years
the
association
has
involved
leading
professional
educators
and
therapists
alongside
parents
in
the
production
of
numerous
publications
on
specific
toys
and
aspects
of
play
in
its
early
years
the
association
was
opposed
by
the
toy
industry
because
it
was
likely
to
reduce
sales
of
toys
as
children
were
borrowing
them
clients
send
a
steady
stream
of
clues
and
messages
through
their
facial
expression
body
movement
and
voice
pitch
counselors
need
to
learn
how
to
read
these
messages
without
distorting
or
overinterpreting
them
in
order
to
establish
and
maintain
relationships
with
their
clients
for
instance
when
denise
says
to
jennie
it
seems
that
it
hard
for
you
to
talk
about
yourself
jennie
says
no
i
don
mind
at
all
but
the
real
answer
is
probably
in
her
nonverbal
behavior
for
she
speaks
hesitatingly
while
looking
away
and
frowning
reading
such
clues
helps
denise
understand
jennie
better
our
nonverbal
behavior
has
a
way
of
leaking
messages
about
what
we
really
mean
the
unplanned
nature
of
nonverbal
behavior
contributes
to
this
leakage
even
in
the
case
of
highly
defensive
clients
sweeping
statements
have
been
made
about
the
effect
of
clothing
on
the
behavior
of
a
child
it
has
been
said
that
a
child
who
is
better
dressed
is
better
behaved
and
that
a
child
who
is
dressed
like
a
cowboy
is
louder
than
he
is
when
dressed
in
ordinary
clothes
clothing
however
might
have
a
temporary
effect
on
the
behavior
of
the
child
but
not
a
lasting
effect
that
is
we
would
predict
that
a
child
who
was
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
and
whose
mother
stressed
that
they
were
best
would
be
better
behaved
for
a
short
period
but
by
the
end
of
the
hour
the
child
would
have
forgotten
his
clothes
and
would
be
acting
as
he
would
in
old
clothes
likewise
the
child
who
is
dressed
in
a
cowboy
outfit
might
be
very
noisy
while
playing
cowboys
for
a
brief
time
but
he
might
soon
change
to
another
activity
and
be
no
more
noisy
than
usual
due
to
this
trade
the
plant
variety
became
widespread
in
a
region
for
thousands
of
years
farmers
at
harvest
time
have
selected
seeds
cuttings
or
tubers
from
superior
plants
to
save
for
the
next
planting
farmers
often
protected
the
stored
seeds
from
insects
or
animals
by
sealing
them
in
clay
pots
or
burying
them
in
baskets
covered
with
ash
they
also
often
stored
tubers
in
cold
areas
and
either
replanted
cuttings
immediately
or
kept
them
dry
until
the
next
planting
time
farmers
thus
saved
their
genetic
stocks
from
season
to
season
they
could
exchange
remaining
stocks
with
neighbors
or
exchange
them
in
the
local
market
organized
seed
production
however
did
not
begin
until
the
early
s
a
study
found
that
enrollment
in
physical
education
classes
was
not
related
to
academic
achievement
scores
but
involvement
in
vigorous
physical
activity
was
students
who
engaged
in
vigorous
activity
outside
of
school
at
least
minutes
per
day
three
days
per
week
were
found
to
have
higher
academic
scores
students
in
the
physical
education
class
spent
an
average
of
only
minutes
out
of
a
minute
class
engaged
in
moderate
to
vigorous
physical
activity
given
that
this
amount
and
intensity
of
activity
in
physical
education
classes
had
no
correlation
to
students
academic
achievement
whereas
there
was
a
significant
association
between
academic
achievement
and
vigorous
activity
outside
of
school
the
researchers
propose
that
there
may
be
a
certain
minimum
level
of
activity
necessary
to
produce
the
potentially
desirable
effects
intense

the
tragic
heroes
in
shakespeare
plays
have
free

they
possess
their
own
defects
of

that
bring
their
downfalls
macbeth
is
ambitious
but
weak
othello
is
jealous
hamlet
cannot
make
up
his
mind
but
all
three
might
have
made
themselves
into
better
human
beings
nothing
outside
themselves
prevents
them
from
taking
the
right
path
as
opposed
to
the
wrong
or
tragic
path
on
the
other
hand
for
the
heroes
in
greek
tragedies
where
fate
embodied
in
the
oracles
prevails
there
is
no
free
will
the
gods
control
a
man
destiny
and
one
cannot
fight
the
gods
regardless
of
their
strength
or
wisdom
the
heroes
cannot
control
their
own
future
that
is
why
the
heroes
in
greek
tragedies
can
be
compared
to
fish
in

and

heroes
when
we
look
at
the
world
and
ourselves
we
do
it
through
a
set
of
filters
think
about
what
a
filter
is
a
filter
is
a
mechanism
that
lets
some
things
flow
in
but
screens
other
things
out
a
through
them
we
process
and
assign
a
weight
and
meaning
to
every
event
in
our
lives
some
things
flow
in
others
are
screened
out
but
everything
is
affected
not
just
what
we
see 
but
what
we
hear
and
believe 
b
depending
on
what
the
filter
is
made
up
of
it
can
also
alter
whatever
is
looked
at
or
passes
through
it
sunglasses
are
a
good
example
of
a
visual
filter
c
but
obviously
i
am
not
talking
here
about
some
physical
apparatus
that
we
can
put
on
and
take
off
like
a
pair
of
glasses
in
fact
the
filters
i
am
mentioning
are
internal
mental
emotional
verbal
and
perceptual
in
nature
the
descriptions
of
sound
production
have
been
rewritten
in
this
edition
so
as
to
update
the
theory
on
which
they
were
based
and
to
provide
better
practical
advice
regarding
pronunciation
problems
several
figures
have
been
redrawn
in
order
to
achieve
greater
accuracy
and
clearer
detail
the
authors
have
tried
to
eliminate
traces
of
gender
biased
attitudes
wherever
they
were
detected
and
a
definite
attempt
has
been
made
to
balance
female
and
male
references
the
most
significant
kind
of
change
in
the
new
edition
however
is
the
result
of
the
effort
we
have
made
to
introduce
more
use
of
language
for
real
communicative
purposes
in
the
learning
activities
suggested
for
students
to
carry
out
the
introduction
of
the
player
piano
in
the
united
states
at
the
turn
of
the
th
century
had
been
accompanied
by
fairly
critical
comments
player
pianos
produced
music
mechanically
through
a
set
of
instructions
stored
on
a
music
roll
although
proponents
of
the
player
piano
such
as
piano
manufacturers
and
publishers
of
sheet
music
thought
that
it
would
lead
to
an
almost
universal
music
education 
many
music
teachers
musicians
and
composers
opposed
it
opponents
claimed
that
one
could
copy
sound
but
not
interpretation
and
that
mechanical
instruments
reduced
the
expression
of
music
to
mathematical
systems
for
this
reason
they
believed
that
mechanized
music
lessened
the
ideal
of
beauty
by
producing
the
same
after
same
with
no
soul
no
joy
no
passion 
and

at

were
fooling
around
on

they
had
discovered
a
great

of

would

down

would

had
not

to
cause
serious
harm

that
in

they
had

explained
that
the

would

to

a

for
weeks
and

lots
of
ordinary
things
would
be

pointed

one
difference
between
winners
and
losers
is
how
they
handle
losing
even
for
the
best
companies
and
most
accomplished
professionals
long
track
records
of
success
are
punctuated
by
slips
slides
and
mini
turnarounds
even
the
team
that
wins
the
game
might
make
mistakes
and
lag
behind
for
part
of
it
that
why
the
ability
to
recover
quickly
is
so
important
troubles
are
ubiquitous
surprises
can
fall
from
the
sky
like
volcanic
ash
and
appear
to
change
everything
that
why
one
prominent
scholar
said
anything
can
look
like
a
failure
in
the
middle
thus
a
key
factor
in
high
achievement
is
bouncing
back
from
the
low
points
as
i
walked
to
the
train
station
i
felt
the
warm
sun
on
my
back
i
caught
my
train
on
time
it
arrived
at
my
destination
ten
minutes
early
which
was
perfect
as
i
was
due
to
present
my
new
idea
to
the
company
at
a
m
the
presentation
went
better
than
expected
and
my
manager
seemed
particularly
pleased
later
that
day
my
manager
called
me
into
her
office
she
smiled
at
me
and
said
james
you
been
with
us
for
six
years
now
how
would
you
feel
if
i
were
to
offer
you
the
sales
director
position
in
london
sales
director
in
london
wow
this
was
a
dream
come
TRUE
for
me
i
couldn
believe
what
i
had
just
heard
many
disciplines
are
better
learned
by
entering
into
the
doing
than
by
mere
abstract
study
this
is
often
the
case
with
the
most
abstract
as
well
as
the
seemingly
more
practical
disciplines
for
example
within
the
philosophical
disciplines
logic
must
be
learned
through
the
use
of
examples
and
actual
problem
solving
only
after
some
time
and
struggle
does
the
student
begin
to
develop
the
insights
and
intuitions
that
enable
him
to
see
the
centrality
and
relevance
of
this
mode
of
thinking
this
learning
by
doing
is
essential
in
many
of
the
sciences
for
instance
only
after
a
good
deal
of
observation
do
the
sparks
in
the
bubble
chamber
become
recognizable
as
the
specific
movements
of
identifiable
particles
the
most
normal
and
competent
child
encounters
what
seem
like
insurmountable
problems
in
living
but
by
playing
them
out
he
may
become
able
to
cope
with
them
in
a
step
by
step
process
he
often
does
so
in
symbolic
ways
that
are
hard
for
even
him
to
understand
as
he
is
reacting
to
inner
processes
whose
origin
may
be
buried
deep
in
his
unconscious
this
may
result
in
play
that
makes
little
sense
to
us
at
the
moment
since
we
do
not
know
the
purposes
it
serves
when
there
is
no
immediate
danger
it
is
usually
best
to
approve
of
the
child
play
without
interfering
efforts
to
assist
him
in
his
struggles
while
well
intentioned
may
divert
him
from
seeking
and
eventually
finding
the
solution
that
will
serve
him
best
at
some
time
in
their
lives
most
people
pause
to
reflect
on
their
own
moral
principles
and
on
the
practical
implications
of
those
principles
and
they
sometimes
think
about
what
principles
people
should
have
or
which
moral
standards
can
be
best
justified
when
a
person
accepts
a
moral
principle
naturally
the
person
believes
the
principle
is
important
and
well
justified
but
there
is
more
to
moral
principles
than
that
when
a
principle
is
part
of
a
person 
moral
code
that
person
is
strongly
motivated
toward
the
conduct
required
by
the
principle
and
against
behavior
that
conflicts
with
that
principle
the
person
will
tend
to
feel
guilty
when
his
or
her
own
conduct
violates
that
principle
and
to
disapprove
of
others
whose
behavior
conflicts
with
it
likewise
the
person
will
tend
to
hold
in
esteem
those
whose
conduct
shows
an
abundance
of
the
motivation
required
by
the
principle
the
key
to
successful
risk
taking
is
to
understand
that
the
actions
you 
taking
should
be
the
natural
next
step
one
of
the
mistakes
we
often
make
when
confronting
a
risk
situation
is
our
tendency
to
focus
on
the
end
result
skiers
who
are
unsure
of
themselves
often
do
this
they 
go
to
the
edge
of
a
difficult
slope
look
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
and
determine
that
the
slope
is
too
steep
for
them
to
try
the
ones
that
decide
to
make
it
change
their
focus
by
analyzing
what
they
need
to
do
to
master
the
first
step
like
getting
through
the
first
mogul
on
the
hill
once
they
get
there
they
concentrate
on
the
next
mogul
and
over
the
course
of
the
run
they
end
up
at
the
bottom
of
what
others
thought
was
an
impossible
mountain
the
th
century
is
called
the
golden
age
of
botanical
painting
and
georg
dionysius
ehret
is
often
praised
as
the
greatest
botanical
artist
of
the
time
born
in
heidelberg
germany
he
was
the
son
of
a
gardener
who
taught
him
much
about
art
and
nature
as
a
young
man
ehret
traveled
around
europe
largely
on
foot
observing
plants
and
developing
his
artistic
skills
in
holland
he
became
acquainted
with
the
swedish
naturalist
carl
linnaeus
through
his
collaborations
with
linnaeus
and
others
ehret
provided
illustrations
for
a
number
of
significant
horticultural
publications
reputation
for
scientific
accuracy
gained
him
many
commissions
from
wealthy
patrons

in

he

during
the
early
stages
when
the
aquaculture
industry
was
rapidly
expanding
mistakes
were
made
and
these
were
costly
both
in
terms
of
direct
losses
and
in
respect
of
the
industry 
image
high
density
rearing
led
to
outbreaks
of
infectious
diseases
that
in
some
cases
devastated
not
just
the
caged
fish
but
local
wild
fish
populations
too
the
negative
impact
on
local
wildlife
inhabiting
areas
close
to
the
fish
farms
continues
to
be
an
ongoing
public
relations
problem
for
the
industry
furthermore
a
general
lack
of
knowledge
and
insufficient
care
being
taken
when
fish
pens
were
initially
constructed
meaning
that
pollution
from
excess
feed
and
fish
waste
created
huge
barren
underwater
deserts
these
were
costly
lessons
to
learn
but
now
stricter
regulations
are
in
place
to
ensure
that
fish
pens
are
placed
in
sites
where
there
is
good
water
flow
to
remove
fish
waste
this
in
addition
to
other
methods
that
decrease
the
overall
amount
of
uneaten
food
has
helped
aquaculture
to
clean
up
its
act
nancy
was
struggling
to
see
the
positive
when
her
teen
daughter
was
experiencing
a
negative
perspective
on
her
life
and
abilities
in
her
desire
to
parent
intentionally
she
went
into
her
daughter
room
and
noted
one
positive
accomplishment
she
had
observed
i
know
you
been
having
a
hard
time
lately
and
you
aren
feeling
really
good
or
positive
about
your
life
but
you
did
a
great
job
cleaning
up
your
room
today
and
i
know
that
must
have
been
a
big
effort
for
you
the
next
day
to
nancy
surprise
the
teen
girl
seemed
somewhat
cheerful
in
passing
she
said
mom
thanks
for
saying
the
positive
thing
about
me
yesterday
i
was
feeling
so
down
and
couldn
think
of
anything
good
about
myself
after
you
said
that
positive
thing
it
helped
me
see
one
good
quality
in
myself
and
i
been
holding
onto
those
words
while
the
eye
sees
at
the
surface
the
ear
tends
to
penetrate
below
the
surface
joachim
ernst
berendt
points
out
that
the
ear
is
the
only
sense
that
a
fuses
replaces
an
ability
to
measure
with
an
ability
to
judge
we
can
discern
different
colors
but
we
can
give
a
precise
number
to
different
sounds
our
eyes
do
not
let
us
perceive
with
this
kind
of
b
diversity
precision
an
unmusical
person
can
recognize
an
octave
and
perhaps
once
instructed
a
quality
of
tone
that
is
a
c
or
an
f
sharp
berendt
points
out
that
there
are
few
acoustical
illusions
something
sounding
like
something
that
in
fact
it
is
not
while
there
are
many
optical
illusions
the
ears
do
not
lie
the
sense
of
hearing
gives
us
a
remarkable
connection
with
the
invisible
underlying
order
of
things
through
our
ears
we
gain
access
to
vibration
which
c
underlies
undermines
everything
around
us
the
sense
of
tone
and
music
in
another
voice
gives
us
an
enormous
amount
of
information
about
that
person
about
her
stance
toward
life
about
her
intentions
the
concept
of
humans
doing
multiple
things
at
a
time
has
been
studied
by
psychologists
since
the
s
but
the
term
multitasking
didn
exist
until
the
s
it
was
used
to
describe
computers
not
people
back
then
ten
megahertz
was
so
fast
that
a
new
word
was
needed
to
describe
a
computer
ability
to
quickly
perform
many
tasks
in
retrospect
they
probably
made
a
poor
choice
for
the
expression
multitasking
is
inherently
deceptive
multitasking
is
about
multiple
tasks
alternately
sharing
one
resource
the
cpu
but
in
time
the
context
was
flipped
and
it
became
interpreted
to
mean
multiple
tasks
being
done
simultaneously
by
one
resource
a
person
it
was
a
clever
turn
of
phrase
that
misleading
for
even
computers
can
process
only
one
piece
of
code
at
a
time
when
they
multitask
they
switch
back
and
forth
alternating
their
attention
until
both
tasks
are
done
the
speed
with
which
computers
tackle
multiple
tasks
that
everything
happens
at
the
same
time
so
comparing
computers
to
humans
can
be
confusing
my
friend
was
disappointed
that
scientific
progress
has
not
cured
the
world 
ills
by
abolishing
wars
and
starvation
that
gross
human
inequality
is
still
widespread
that
happiness
is
not
universal
my
friend
made
a
common
mistake
a
basic
misunderstanding
in
the
nature
of
knowledge
knowledge
is
amoral
not
immoral
but
morality
neutral
it
can
be
used
for
any
purpose
but
many
people
assume
it
will
be
used
to
further
their
favorite
hopes
for
society
and
this
is
the
fundamental
flaw
knowledge
of
the
world
is
one
thing
its
uses
create
a
separate
issue
to
be
disappointed
that
our
progress
in
understanding
has
not
remedied
the
social
ills
of
the
world
is
a
legitimate
view
but
to
argue
that
knowledge
is
not
progressing
because
of
the
african
or
middle
eastern
conflicts
misses
the
point
there
is
nothing
inherent
in
knowledge
that
dictates
any
specific
social
or
moral
application
according
to
a
renowned
french
scholar
the
growth
in
the
size
and
complexity
of
human
populations
was
the
driving
force
in
the
evolution
of
science
early
small
communities
had
to
concentrate
all
their
physical
and
mental
effort
on
survival
their
thoughts
were
focused
on
food
and
religion
as
communities
became
larger
some
people
had
time
to
reflect
and
debate
they
found
that
they
could
understand
and
predict
events
better
if
they
reduced
passion
and
prejudice
replacing
these
with
observation
and
inference
but
while
a
large
population
may
have
been
necessary
in
itself
it
was
not
sufficient
for
science
to
germinate
some
empires
were
big
but
the
rigid
social
control
required
to
hold
an
empire
together
was
not
beneficial
to
science
just
as
it
was
not
beneficial
to
reason
the
early
nurturing
and
later
flowering
of
science
to
support
original
thought
and
freewheeling
incentive
the
rise
in
commerce
and
the
decline
of
authoritarian
religion
allowed
science
to
follow
reason
in
seventeenth
century
europe
new
media
can
be
defined
by
four
characteristics
simultaneously
they
are
media
at
the
turn
of
the
th
and
st
centuries
which
are
both
integrated
and
interactive
and
use
digital
code
and
hypertext
as
technical
means
it
follows
that
their
most
common
alternative
names
are
multimedia
interactive
media
and
digital
media
by
using
this
definition
it
is
easy
to
identify
media
as
old
or
new
a
traditional
television
is
integrated
as
it
contains
images
sound
and
text
but
it
is
not
interactive
or
based
on
digital
code
the
plain
old
telephone
was
interactive
but
not
integrated
as
it
only
transmitted
speech
and
sounds
and
it

a
currently
popular
attitude
is
to
blame
technology
or
technologists
for
having
brought
on
the
environmental
problems
we
face
today
and
thus
to
try
to
slow
technological
advance
by
blocking
economic
growth
we
believe
this
view
to
be
thoroughly
misguided
if
technology
produced
automobiles
that
pollute
the
air
it
is
because
pollution
was
not
recognized
as
a
problem
which
engineers
had
to
consider
in
their
designs
solar
energy
can
be
a
practical
alternative
energy
source
for
us
in
the
foreseeable
future
obviously
technology
that
produces
pollution
is
generally
cheaper
but
now
that
it
has
been
decided
that
cleaner
cars
are
wanted
less
polluting
cars
will
be
produced
cars
which
scarcely
pollute
at
all
could
even
be
made
this
last
option
however
would
require
several
years
and
much
investment
although
technology
is
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
people
it
can
seldom
respond
instantaneously
and
is
never
free
the
impact
of
color
has
been
studied
for
decades
for
example
in
a
factory
the
temperature
was
maintained
at
and
the
walls
were
painted
a
cool
blue
green
the
employees
complained
of
the
cold
a
the
psychological
effects
of
warm
and
cool
hues
seem
to
be
used
effectively
by
the
coaches
of
the
notre
dame
football
team
the
locker
rooms
used
for
half
time
breaks
were
reportedly
painted
to
take
advantage
of
the
emotional
impact
of
certain
hues
b
the
home
team
room
was
painted
a
bright
red
which
kept
team
members
excited
or
even
angered
the
visiting
team
room
was
painted
a
blue
green
which
had
a
calming
effect
on
the
team
members
the
success
of
this
application
of
color
can
be
noted
in
the
records
set
by
notre
dame
football
teams
c
the
temperature
was
maintained
at
the
same
level
but
the
walls
were
painted
a
warm
coral
the
employees
stopped
complaining
about
the
temperature
and
reported
they
were
quite
comfortable
food
plays
a
large
part
in
how
much
you
enjoy
the
outdoors
the
possibilities
are
endless
so
you
can
constantly
vary
your
diet
a
they
walk
only
a
few
miles
each
day
and
may
use
the
same
campsite
for
several
nights
survival
eaters
eat
some
dry
cereal
for
breakfast
and
are
up
and
walking
within
minutes
of
waking
b
wilderness
dining
has
two
extremes
gourmet
eaters
and
survival
eaters
the
first
like
to
make
camp
at
lunchtime
so
they
have
several
hours
to
set
up
field
ovens
they
bake
cakes
and
bread
and
cook
multi
course
dinners
c
they
walk
dozens
of
miles
every
day
lunch
is
a
series
of
cold
snacks
eaten
on
the
move
dinner
consists
of
a
freeze
dried
meal
cooked
by
pouring
hot
water
into
the
package
the
researchers
had
made
this
happen
by
lengthening
the
period
of
daylight
to
which
the
peach
trees
on
whose
roots
the
insects
fed
were
exposed
exactly
how
cicadas
keep
track
of
time
has
always
intrigued
researchers
and
it
has
always
been
assumed
that
the
insects
must
rely
on
an
internal
clock
recently
however
one
group
of
scientists
working
with
the
year
cicada
in
california
have
suggested
that
the
nymphs
use
an
external
cue
and
that
they
can
count
for
their
experiments
they
took
year
old
nymphs
and
moved
them
to
an
experimental
enclosure
these
nymphs
should
have
taken
a
further
two
years
to
emerge
as
adults
but
in
fact
they
took
just
one
year
by
doing
this
the
trees
were
tricked
into
flowering
twice
during
the
year
rather
than
the
usual
once
flowering
in
trees
coincides
with
a
peak
in
amino
acid
concentrations
in
the
sap
that
the
insects
feed
on
so
it
seems
that
the
cicadas
keep
track
of
time
by
counting
the
peaks
they
also
rated
how
generally
extroverted
those
fake
extroverts
appeared
based
on
their
recorded
voices
and
body
language
some
years
ago
a
psychologist
named
richard
lippa
called
a
group
of
introverts
to
his
lab
and
asked
them
to
act
like
extroverts
while
pretending
to
teach
a
math
class
then
he
and
his
team
with
video
cameras
in
hand
measured
the
length
of
their
strides
the
amount
of
eye
contact
they
made
with
their
students
the
percentage
of
time
they
spent
talking
and
the
volume
of
their
speech
then
lippa
did
the
same
thing
with
actual
extroverts
and
compared
the
results
he
found
that
although
the
latter
group
came
across
as
more
extroverted
some
of
the
fake
extroverts
were
surprisingly
convincing
it
seems
that
most
of
us
know
how
to
fake
it
to
some
extent
whether
or
not
we
aware
that
the
length
of
our
strides
and
the
amount
of
time
we
spend
talking
and
smiling
mark
us
as
introverts
and
extroverts
we
know
it
unconsciously
plato
and
tolstoy
both
assume
that
it
can
be
firmly
established
that
certain
works
have
certain
effects
plato
is
sure
that
the
representation
of
cowardly
people
makes
us
cowardly
the
only
way
to
prevent
this
effect
is
to
suppress
such
representations
tolstoy
is
confident
that
the
artist
who
sincerely
expresses
feelings
of
pride
will
pass
those
feelings
on
to
us
we
can
no
more
escape
than
we
could
escape
an
infectious
disease
in
fact
however
the
effects
of
art
are
neither
so
certain
nor
so
direct
people
vary
a
great
deal
both
in
the
intensity
of
their
response
to
art
and
in
the
form
which
that
response
takes
some
people
may
indulge
fantasies
of
violence
by
watching
a
film
instead
of
working
out
those
fantasies
in
real
life
others
may
be
disgusted
by
even
glamorous
representations
of
violence
still
others
may
be
left
unmoved
neither
attracted
nor
disgusted
increased

a

these

may
reflect
the
greater
need
of
larger

to
solve

problems
members
may
realize
that
their

must

since
it

but
for
all
of
these
difficulties
for
psychology
the
payoff
of
the
scientific
method
is
that
the
findings
are
replicable
that
is
if
you
run
the
same
study
again
following
the
same
procedures
you
will
be
very
likely
to
get
the
same
results
b
it
often
requires
compromises
such
as
testing
behavior
within
laboratories
rather
than
natural
settings
and
asking
those
readily
available
such
as
introduction
to
psychology
students
to
participate
rather
than
collecting
data
from
a
TRUE
cross
section
of
the
population
it
often
requires
great
cleverness
to
conceive
of
measures
that
tap
into
what
people
are
thinking
without
altering
their
thinking
called
reactivity
c
simply
knowing
they
are
being
observed
may
cause
people
to
behave
differently
such
as
more
politely
people
may
give
answers
that
they
feel
are
more
socially
desirable
than
their
TRUE
feelings
a
likewise
if
there
are
things
you
can
recall
your
schemata
will
fill
in
the
gaps
with
knowledge
about
what
typical
in
that
situation
as
a
result
a
reliance
on
schemata
will
inevitably
make
the
world
seem
more
normal
than
it
really
is
and
will
make
the
past
seem
more
regular
than
it
actually
was
b
any
reliance
on
schematic
knowledge
therefore
will
be
shaped
by
this
information
about
what
normal
thus
if
there
are
things
you
don
notice
while
viewing
a
situation
or
event
your
schemata
will
lead
you
to
fill
in
these
gaps
with
knowledge
about
what
normally
in
place
in
that
setting
c
but
schematic
knowledge
can
also
hurt
you
promoting
errors
in
perception
and
memory
moreover
the
types
of
errors
produced
by
schemata
are
quite
predictable
bear
in
mind
that
schemata
summarize
the
broad
pattern
of
your
experience
and
so
they
tell
you
in
essence
what
typical
or
ordinary
in
a
given
situation
a
the
bad
guys
are
usually
punished
the
romantic
couple
almost
always
find
each
other
despite
the
obstacles
and
difficulties
they
encounter
on
the
path
to
TRUE
love
and
the
way
we
wish
the
world
to
be
is
how
in
the
movies
it
more
often
than
not
winds
up
being
no
doubt
it
is
this
utopian
aspect
of
movies
that
accounts
for
why
we
enjoy
them
so
much
b
the
simple
answer
to
this
question
is
that
movies
do
more
than
present
two
hour
civics
lessons
or
editorials
on
responsible
behavior
they
also
tell
stories
that
in
the
end
we
find
satisfying
c
but
one
may
ask
why
audiences
would
find
such
movies
enjoyable
if
all
they
do
is
give
cultural
directives
and
prescriptions
for
proper
living
most
of
us
would
likely
grow
tired
of
such
didactic
movies
and
would
probably
come
to
see
them
as
propaganda
similar
to
the
cultural
artwork
that
was
common
in
the
soviet
union
and
other
autocratic
societies
a
some
discoveries
seem
to
entail
numerous
phases
and
discoverers
none
of
which
can
be
identified
as
definitive
furthermore
the
evaluation
of
past
discoveries
and
discoverers
according
to
present
day
standards
does
not
allow
us
to
see
how
significant
they
may
have
been
in
their
own
day
b
this
entailed
relating
the
progressive
accumulation
of
breakthroughs
and
discoveries
only
that
which
survived
in
some
form
in
the
present
was
considered
relevant
in
the
mid
s
however
a
number
of
faults
in
this
view
of
history
became
apparent
closer
analysis
of
scientific
discoveries
for
instance
led
historians
to
ask
whether
the
dates
of
discoveries
and
their
discoverers
can
be
identified
precisely
c
nor
does
the
traditional
view
recognise
the
role
that
non
intellectual
factors
especially
institutional
and
socio
economic
ones
play
in
scientific
developments
most
importantly
however
the
traditional
historian
of
science
seems
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
concepts
questions
and
standards
that
they
use
to
frame
the

are

in

real

war
larger

is
always
a

purpose
it

the

this
insight
was
famously
captured
by
clausewitz
most
famous
phrase
war
is
a
mere
continuation
of
politics
by
other
means
c
and
one
side
will
has
to
be
transmitted
to
the
enemy
at
some
point
during
the
confrontation
it
does
not
have
to
be
publicly
communicated
a
violent
act
and
its
larger
political
intention
must
also
be
attributed
to
one
side
at
some
point
during
the
confrontation
history
does
not
know
of
acts
of
war
without
eventual
attribution
a
and
this
has
direct
repercussions
at
the
individual
level
households
can
reduce
the
cost
of
electricity
and
gas
bills
and
improve
their
health
and
comfort
while
companies
can
increase
their
competitiveness
and
their
productivity
finally
the
market
for
energy
efficiency
could
contribute
to
the
economy
through
job
and
firms
creation
b
there
are
significant
externalities
to
take
into
account
and
there
are
also
macroeconomic
effects
for
instance
at
the
aggregate
level
improving
the
level
of
national
energy
efficiency
has
positive
effects
on
macroeconomic
issues
such
as
energy
dependence
climate
change
health
national
competitiveness
and
reducing
fuel
poverty
c
however
the
calculation
of
such
cost
effectiveness
is
not
easy
it
is
not
simply
a
case
of
looking
at
private
costs
and
comparing
them

the

a
many
examples
of
such
green
taxes
exist
facing
landfill
costs
labor
expenses
and
related
costs
in
the
provision
of
garbage
disposal
for
example
some
cities
have
required
households
to
dispose
of
all
waste
in
special
trash
bags
purchased
by
consumers
themselves
and
often
costing
a
dollar
or
more
each
b
taxing
certain
goods
or
services
and
so
increasing
prices
should
result
in
either
decreased
use
of
these
resources
or
creative
innovation
of
new
sources
or
options
the
money
raised
through
the
tax
can
be
used
directly
by
the
government
either
to
supply
services
or
to
search
for
alternatives
c
the
results
have
been
greatly
increased
recycling
and
more
careful
attention
by
consumers
to
packaging
and
waste
by
internalizing
the
costs
of
trash
to
consumers

has
been
an
observed
decrease
in

heritage
and
environment
the
mind
functions
as
a
filter
every
outside
impression
that
passes
through
it
is
filtered
and
interpreted
however
the
world
the
reader
encounters
in
literature
is
already
processed
and
filtered
by
another
consciousness
c
the
existing
world
faced
by
the
individual
is
in
principle
an
infinite
chaos
of
events
and
details
before
it
is
organized
by
a
human
mind
this
chaos
only
gets
processed
and
modified
when
perceived
by
a
human
mind
classifying
things
together
into
groups
is
something
we
do
all
the
time
and
it
isn
hard
to
see
why
imagine
trying
to
shop
in
a
supermarket
where
the
food
was
arranged
in
random
order
on
the
shelves
tomato
soup
next
to
the
white
bread
in
one
aisle
chicken
soup
in
the
back
next
to
the
watt
light
bulbs
one
brand
of
cream
cheese
in
front
and
another
in
aisle
near
the
cookies
the
task
of
finding
what
you
want
would
be
a
time
consuming
and
extremely
difficult
if
not
impossible
in
the
case
of
a
supermarket
someone
had
to
b
design
the
system
of
classification
but
there
is
also
a
ready
made
system
of
classification
embodied
in
our
language
the
word
dog
for
example
groups
together
a
certain
class
of
animals
and
distinguishes
them
from
other
animals
such
a
grouping
may
seem
too
c
abstract
to
be
called
a
classification
but
this
is
only
because
you
have
already
mastered
the
word
as
a
child
learning
to
speak
you
had
to
work
hard
to
d
learn
the
system
of
classification
your
parents
were
trying
to
teach
you
before
you
got
the
hang
of
it
you
probably
made
mistakes
like
calling
the
cat
a
dog
if
you
hadn
learned
to
speak
the
whole
world
would
seem
like
the
e
unorganized
supermarket
you
would
be
in
the
position
of
an
infant
for
whom
every
object
is
new
and
unfamiliar
in
learning
the
principles
of
classification
therefore
we
be
learning
about
the

the
